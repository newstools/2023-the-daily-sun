The City of Johannesburg MMC for Roads and Transport Kenny Kunene has lashed out at workers who are on strike. Kunene was briefing the media in Braamfontein, Johannesburg on Thursday, 9 March giving an update on issues involving the Johannesburg Road Agency (JRA), Metro Bus and Rea Vaya. He said some workers have refused to work even though they were on duty claiming that they are on a sit-in strike. Kunene said potholes are not being fixed and roads are not maintained because workers come to work with SAMWU t-shirts and think they are going to intimidate them. “The people of Joburg are suffering because workers are not doing what they are paid to do. When people are looking for jobs, they beg, cry, and say they have families but once they get the job, they become lazy and disrespectful,” he said.

"It is an embarrassment. And every time I see them the pain I feel is excruciating,” he said. Kunene has also clarified what led to Rea Vaya drivers downing tools. He said part of the problem was with the bus company Rea Vaya is in business with had not submitted its tax clearance certificate, which delayed the city from making the salary payments.
