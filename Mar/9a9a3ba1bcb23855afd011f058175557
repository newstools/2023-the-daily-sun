THE state and former Bosasa COO, Angelo Agrizzi, have agreed that he can attend his R1,8 billion fraud and corruption trial virtually. The Investigating Directorate had brought two applications in the Pretoria High Court that Agrizzi had to prove that his failure to attend trial was not his fault and that it was not a delaying tactic. The state objected to continue with the matter in the absence of the accused on Tuesday, 7 March. Agrizzi, who has been unwell since late 2020, a day after his arrest, is accused with Linda Mti, former DCS Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and Patrick Gillingham, former BOSASA CFO for fraud and corruption. Bosasa scored contracts totaling just more than R1 billion from the Department of Correctional Services between 2004 and 2007. The tender was for rendering catering and training services, installation of CCTV cameras, installing the perimeter fencing and supplying a television system and monitoring equipment.
