TWO men were arrested for possession of illegal firearms and dealing in illicit drugs on Friday, 10 March. They were nabbed in the Boklein Administrative Area in Engcobo in the Eastern Cape. "It is alleged that members of the Tactical Response Team swiftly responded to information of suspects believed to be in possession of firearms. Intelligence-driven information was operationalised where members in possession of search warrants pounced on two houses in Boklein A/A," said police spokeswoman Captain Namhla Mdleleni. She said two suspects, aged 35 and 52, were arrested and two firearms were seized. "A total of 54 Tik straws and 27 Boss Mandrax were recovered. Preliminary investigation revealed that one of the firearms was stolen in Delft five years ago," said Mdleleni.  She said both suspects were arrested and will appear in the Engcobo Magistrates Court on Monday, 13 March. Chris Hani District commissioner Major General Rudolph Adolph applauded members for the quick response. "As long as there are firearms in the wrong hands, we will intensify our operations with the assistance from intelligence services to ensure that we remove illegal firearms from our communities," said Adolph.
