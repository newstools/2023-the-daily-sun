FORMER Bosasa executive Angelo Agrizzi's attempt to prove unfitness to stand trial has been postponed indefinitely by the High Court. On Wednesday, 8 March, the North Gauteng High Court adjourned Agrizzi's two applications. ID spokeswoman Sindisiwe Seboka said in terms Section 67 (2) b Code of Criminal Procedure (CPA), which states that if an accused convinces the court that his failure, is not due to his fault, the provisional revocation of bail and provisional forfeiture of bail money shall lapse. She said the second motion was based on Section 342A of the CPA, which refers to unreasonable delays. ALSO READ: Agrizzi to attend his trail virtually! "A court in which criminal proceedings are pending shall consider any delay in the conclusion of the proceedings that appears to the court to be unreasonable and that could cause substantial prejudice to the prosecution, the defendant or his counsel, the state, or a witness," she said. However, the inquiry applications were postponed indefinitely after Judge David Makhoba ruled that the matter would require more time to be resolved. REGISTER TO COMMENT! Agrizzi was charged with fraud and corruption in relation to R1,8 billion Bosasa and Department of Correctional Services 2004-2007 tenders. Seboka said that the decision on both applications will have an impact on his individual over R800K corruption matter.
