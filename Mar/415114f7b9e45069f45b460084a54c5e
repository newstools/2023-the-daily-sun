THE Labour Court has dismissed Nehawu's application to appeal government’s wage strike. According to the ruling, Nehawu and its member employed by the Department of Public Service and Administration are interdicted and restrained from continuing with or participating in a strike. The order is expected to take effect immediately. This ruling was heard on Monday, 13 March as Nehawu members entered their second week of their protest, which resulted in several disruptions to health services.

Members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) could be seen outside the hospital entrance, where cars were being searched.  Phaahla said he was concerned by the inactivity at the hospital to provide well-needed services and intimidation of non-protesting staff members. As a result, he has beefed up security to ensure both staff and patients were safe. “We need to improve visible security so that staff members who want to come to work can feel safe to come to work. "If we remove the fear and get people to see that government can take their security, the security of the stuff seriously and the security of the patients seriously, then there will be more activity in the hospital,” the minister said.

Previously, Phaahla reported four deaths that could likely be linked to the ongoing protest by the union. However, in his brief on Monday, 13 March, the minister said this death toll continues to increase as reports are received across the country.
