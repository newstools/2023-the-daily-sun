The 63-year-old from Kwaggafontein in Mpumalanga told Daily Sun she had just went inside the house when she heard a big bang. "As soon as I entered the house, I heard a big bang and when I looked at the roof, I saw the wall collapsing and ran outside. I was already out when the roof reached the ground. The whole roof caved inside. I had to stand in the rain and watch my house crumble bit by bit. "I almost died. I thank God and my ancestors for saving me," she said. Gogo Dorah said she used to live with her 19-year-old grandson who has since left to stay with relatives. "My grandson found the house collapsed when he came back. He then decided to go back where he was and left me alone," she said. She said many councillors have registered her for an RDP house, but nothing happened.

I'm still waiting," she said. Gogo said that as help wasn't coming quickly, she decided to build herself a small shack. "I took the roof sheets and used them to build a shack. I used my last money to buy poles and nails. I'm still waiting for help to come," she said. Action SA member Moses Kgomo said he helped gogo report the matter to the municipality. "We are still waiting for the municipality to respond to gogo's plight. We dont know what's delaying them," he said. Thembisile Hani municipal spokeswoman Simphiwe Mashiyane Mokako said a team from disaster management will visit gogo and she will be helped.
