However, an amount of R600 million has since been allocated for the 2023/24 financial year,” she said. Nkomo-Ralehoko said they'd use the R600 million allocated in the 2023/24 financial year to keep as many workers as possible. “However, the appointments will be based on critical, prioritised and urgent service needs at each facility based on the budget allocated,” she said. The MEC said the contracts of the workers, who are professional and support staff including about 113 medical personnel, were previously extended for 12 months in the 2022/2023 financial year and were due to end on 31 March. “The department has communicated the budget cut to all the chief executive officers at facilities and to organised labour. All hospitals have been asked to submit their needs according to their prioritisation.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments “There has also been an agreement on the prioritisation of clinical posts across all hospitals and the process to advertise available posts in line with the allocated budget. The process will be fast-tracked so as not to negatively impact on the facilities,” she said.
