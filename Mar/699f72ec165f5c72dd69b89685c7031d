THE suspect has been cruising in a stolen blue VW Golf 5 R32, but little did he know that the car belonged to a cop. On the other hand, the cop also did not know that the car he was chasing belonged to him. This happened when Metro cops gave chase to a speeding Golf 5 with no registration numbers while they were patrolling on the northbound R21 freeway on Monday, 6 March. The cops cornered the vehicle at the Voortrekker off-ramp in Kempton Park, Ekurhuleni, and the driver (30) was arrested. Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) spokeswoman Constable Marie Mashishi said the cops found a registered 9mm CZ pistol under the car seat. Mashishi said the police learnt that the vehicle was stolen last month in Sandton, Joburg. "On closer inspection, one of the EMPD officers noticed it was his car which he had been looking for all this time after it was stolen,” Mashishi said. ALSO READ: Saftu guns for former Eskom CEO!
