  THE City of Tshwane is holding a special council meeting in an effort to elect a new council speaker. The meeting, however, started with drama as council members were at each other’s throats over the membership termination of Nkele Molapo by ActionSA. The members from the ANC demanded that Molapo be allowed to partake in the voting of the speaker, even after being fired by her party on Sunday, 12 March. ActionSA’s Senate met last night and voted to terminate the membership of Nkele Molapo for collusion against the multi-party Coalition in the City of Tshwane. https://t.co/WAXByC1eF9  ALSO READ: Party takes serious action against councillor The meeting had to be adjourned for two hours so the councilors could compose themselves. The election of the new speaker comes after the position became vacant in February when the disgraced Dr Murunwa Makwarela’s resigned after being elected the City of Tshwane mayor. Makwarela resigned as mayor on Friday, 10 March, after it was found that he submitted a fake document on his insolvency matter. The election of the City of Tshwane speaker will pave the way for the council to get some stability in the city, which is currently without political leadership. Meanwhile, the multi-party coalition has nominated ActionSA’s Kholofelo Morodi to become the speaker of the council.
