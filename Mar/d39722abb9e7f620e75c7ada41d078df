VETERAN SABC1 Zulu news presenter, producer and editor Vusizwe Langa has found a new home on Newzroom Afrika's Nguni news show called Izindaba Zethu. Langa, who had been with the SABC from 2008, is now an executive producer of the show. Newsroom Afrika premiered its Nguni news on Monday, 27 February, on Mzansi Wethu (DStv channel 163) and it airs at the same time as SABC1's Nguni news at 7pm. Langa from Nkandla, KZN, told Daily Sun he left the SABC for greener pastures but the public broadcaster would always be his home.

It was the time for greener pastures," he said. “I’m what I am because of the SABC, starting from Ukhozi FM where I was the current affairs presenter and then programmes presenter. I then joined TV in 2008. It was nice to work with them. I can't complain,” he said. SABC1 weather presenters Diskey Mdlalose and Thabile Makapela as well as voice-over artist Ayanda Ntuli, newsreader Lisakhanya Pepe and many more joined Newzroom Afrika Nguni news, while former SABC news presenters Noxolo Grootboom and Thabile Mbhele also joined. Langa said since they started their news broadcast on Monday, they had been getting a positive response from the viewers.

They appreciate our content quality, TV picture quality. “We promise to continue to give our viewers what is best for them. At the moment I’m still behind the scene cooking news because we just started but as time goes on I will present it,” he said. Langa said they were not competing with the SABC. “Some are saying our structure is similar to the SABC Nguni news. But really all news bulletin structure are similar. You start with headlines and end with weather,” he said. A post shared by Vusizwe langa (@vusizwe_langa)
