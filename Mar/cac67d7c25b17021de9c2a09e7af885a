On Tuesday, 7 March, city manager Johann Mettler wrote to the Gauteng Provincial Electoral Officer informing him of a vacancy which had occurred in the city following the disqualification of Makwarela. However, Makwarela was reinstated after apparently handing over a notice of solvency rehabilitation to the municipal spokesman, Selby Bokaba, on Thursday. Bokaba said Mettler has informed the Gauteng provincial electoral officer of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) to immediately withdraw the declaration of a vacancy for the Cope councillor. “The IEC has confirmed receipt of a letter from the city manager for the withdrawal of the vacancy declaration and undertook to process it accordingly, as they are still within the 21-day time limit. “Accordingly, all the benefits and perks accorded to Dr Makwarela as the executive mayor of the City of Tshwane have forthwith been reinstated,” he said.
