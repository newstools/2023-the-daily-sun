She said she doesn't have any faith in the police because in 2018, a crime prevention imbizo was hosted, with the same promises but no changes were made, and things got worse instead of better. She also said she was aware that her son was on drugs and even had him arrested, only for the son to be out within 48 hours.

Pupils from Westbury Secondary School expressed how terrified they're living in the area. "On 9 February, I was so scared when I heard that there'd been a shooting. My mum was on her way to work, and I wasn't sure if she made it to work. That's the community we live in," one of the pupils said. Police Minister Bheki Cele said he's hurt that the residents have lost faith in the cops. He said that in 2018, some law enforcement agencies were stopped because they assumed the community was in a better place. Cele reassured the community that a team of detectives will be sent to deal with unresolved cases.
