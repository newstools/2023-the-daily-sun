 A male nurse was stabbed while taking a smoke break at the Helen Joseph Hospital! The Gauteng MEC for Health and Wellness, Nomantu Nkomo condemned the attack on the nursing staff at the Hospital by criminals disguised as escorts of an injured patient.

She said that the attackers approached the nurse who had gone outside for a comfort break and attempted to rob him of his cellphone before stabbing him in the parking lot. The MEC expressed how disgraceful it was that people who had come to seek help for their friend who had a stab wound on his hand, can turn and harm those meant to help them.
