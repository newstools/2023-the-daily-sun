DRAMA queen Inno Morolong wants people to know there is more to her than drama and controversy. The 29-year-old controversial social media star has a foundation called Thusang Sechaba Foundation which helps the needy and is currently doing a school shoes drive. She said this way, people will get to know more of her and know she has a good heart. Inno spoke to Daily Sun about the school shoes drive. “This year, I decided that having fun and doing events is my job, not my life. I realised that instead of always focusing on myself, the fun, the glam, let me help as many people as I can. “I sleep good at night when people I have helped come to me and thank me. That keeps me going. People don’t know this side of me. They think I’m all the drama. But I love helping people,” she said. She said she's trying to collect 200 school shoes.

I visited some schools and saw that there are a lot of kids who are struggling and don’t have shoes. “So, I decided this would be good to help school kids. We are not collecting money. We just collect shoes. My goal is to have 200 shoes. At the moment, I only have 20 shoes,” she said. REGISTER TO COMMENT! “I’ll be happy if we can all gather and put smiles on kids’ faces. I hope this will empower other influencers to help me get more shoes. Alone I won’t be able to do it,” said Inno. Speaking about her foundation, she said it helps people and restores their dignity. “I started the foundation a few years ago and it’s a registered NPO. I’ve got an Instagram page that shows the work I’ve done in the past years, especially in the Free State which is where I’m from. I know the struggles of the people there. “Also, we give people dignity as we don’t show their faces. We want to help people and not just show off. It’s not about the clout,” said the social media star.
