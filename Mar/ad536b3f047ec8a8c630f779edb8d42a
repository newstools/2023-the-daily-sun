 THE Constitutional Court has dismissed President Cyril Ramaphosa's application to declare the Phala Phala Farmgate report unlawful and set it aside. Ramaphosa had turned to the Supreme Court in December after the parliament-appointed panel, headed by former chief justice Sandile Ngcobo, made an adverse finding against him. The section 89 panel had found that, based on published information, it appears that Ramaphosa had committed a serious violation of several sections of the Constitution.

According to the findings, the panel had concluded that serious misconduct occurred because the president violated Section 96(2)(b) by exposing himself to a situation involving a conflict between his official duties and his private affairs. They also found that there was a deliberate intention not to investigate the commission of the crime committed on Ramaphosa’s farm in 2020 openly and that he had a case to answer. Delivering its judgment on Wednesday,1 March, the Constitutional Court stated that it had considered the application by way of exclusive jurisdiction or, alternatively, by way of direct access of the main application and the application for leave to intervene. REGISTER TO COMMENT! “It has concluded that no case has been made out for exclusive jurisdiction or direct access, and the main application was dismissed. Consequently, the application to intervene falls to be dismissed. The court decided not to award costs,” read the judgment.
