PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has committed to announce the long-awaited cabinet reshuffle on Monday evening, 6 March. His spokesman Vincent Magwenya said having exercised his constitutional prerogative, the president will announce his new cabinet at 7pm. This comes after mounting pressure from the public and various organisations who accused the president of dragging his feet in announcing the imminent reshuffle.

But according to Magwenya, the speculations on social platforms and media were not true because there was no plan for the president to announce changes to the cabinet on Thursday. He said as a result, there was no postponement or cancellation of such an announcement. “On Friday the 3rd of March, President Ramaphosa honoured an engagement of the Ntaba Nyoni Cattle Stud. This was a dinner preceding an annual auction. The dates for these events were scheduled a number of months ago.” “In view of his discomfort, the president made a brief stop at Friday’s dinner to greet guests. President Ramaphosa did not attend the auction itself the following day as his cold persisted and required that he should rest,” he said.

He said: “While he is still nursing his common cold, the president is finalising his reconfiguration of the National Executive. Furthermore, there have been parliamentary processes such as the swearing in of certain members of Parliament that the president needed to take account of whilst he is finalising the formation of the executive."
