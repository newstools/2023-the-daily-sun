THE victim of gender-based violence, Cleo Diko, was laid to rest at Welmoed Cemetery in Eerste River on Saturday, 4 Marc. There were both tears and songs as friends and family mourned and celebrated Cleo's life. Her mother Linda Diko said she decided not to see her daughter's body, which had already decomposed. "I decided not to look at her decomposed body because that image will never leave my mind. I decided to keep the images of my beautiful child in my mind, not a Cleo that decomposed.

"The undertaker who took care of Cleo's body gave clear instructions to the family that her body should not remain during the service for more than 30 minutes." The family eventually buried her and then proceeded with the funeral program.

We will hold a short service, lasting no more than 30 minutes, so that we can go and lay her to rest. Then we come back and have a main funeral service,” he said. It was a painful sight as Cleo's children watched their mother's body being lowered into the grave. Mhlanganisi Jennings, the father of Cleo's twins, promised those present that he would take care of her children. “The children are in safe hands, even Cleo herself, wherever she is, knows that the children are in safe hands. I will forever miss you and the children will miss you,” he said. Cleo’s body was allegedly found buried under the bed in the home of suspect Sandile Jekwa on 27 January 2023. This happened after she went missing at the KwaPoyo Lounge in Mandalay, where she was having drinks with friends.
