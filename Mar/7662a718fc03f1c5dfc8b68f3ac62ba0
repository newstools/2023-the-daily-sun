"When I went to the scene and saw the dead man's clothes, I immediately knew that it was my brother Sibusiso. Those were the clothes he was wearing when I last saw him.  But I will have to wait for the post mortem to be done before we could arrange his funeral," said Mthokozisi. He said the last time he saw his brother was on 2 December, when he was admitted to hospital after falling sick. "He was alone in the room we shared at the hostel. I heard he went to play the numbers Hollywood bets and won R25 000 and after winning, he went back to the hostel. I suspect that people knew he had won and followed him home. They then killed him and dumped his body in the electrical room," said Mthokozisi.
