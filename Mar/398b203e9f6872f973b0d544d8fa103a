EACH time rain hits Makhabeleni Village in KZN, it means there is no school for children in the area. This is because the pupils have to cross the Umvoti River to go to nearby schools. But they can't cross the river when it's full as they might drown. Six years ago, a kid drowned while crossing the flooded river, and another child drowned two years ago. Now parents want the Department of Education to take over the matter and do something. ALSO READ: Floods displace families! Parent Thembelihle Buthelezi (38) said she has three kids who have to cross the river when they go to school. "Each time the river is full, my children don't go to school.  One is in grade 9 while others are at primary school. They miss out on a lot of work when they don't go to school," she said. "We really want the department to do something. We need a bridge that will sort out this mess." Another parent, Sithembiso Makhoba (42), said this has been a problem of several years. "The schools were built in the early 90s. We can't continue living like this. We want the department to do something because they are aware of this problem," he said. He said they want a bridge. REGISTER TO COMMENT! "This will not only help children but everyone as well. Since this week started, the river is full and no child from our area has been to school. So, this cannot continue," he said. KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said: "When delivering the State of the Province Address, the premier did speak to this issue and made commitments that the Department of Transport will build bridges to assist in that regard."
