THE corruption trial of former Durban mayor Zandile Gumede and others returns to the Durban High Court on Monday, 13 March. Testifying on Tuesday 7 March, Mbuso Ngcobo, who arrived to court with security guards, revealed that allegations of fraud and corruption were brought to them by an anonymous person. The matter was adjourned on Thursday, 9 March, as the defence wanted Ngcobo to provide additional documents relating to the testimony of the anonymous person.
