 THE music industry is mourning the death of gospel singer Innocent "Centy" Modiba (48), who died on Wednesday, 1 March. The news of his death was confirmed by his best friend, Buyani Khoza. “I received a call from his mother on Wednesday morning. He was apparently alone, trying to make tea for himself and he had a seizure,” Buyani said. “After some time, his relatives went to his room and found it closed. They knocked but there was no response. Eventually, they opened the room and found him on the floor. Unfortunately, by that time he’d already passed away,” he said.  Buyani said that the last time he saw him was on Sunday, 26 February. “We were planning to see each other on Monday. But that didn’t happen because I couldn’t reach him on his phone.” ALSO READ : End of the road for Diep City!  "On Tuesday, he sent me a text message and told me he was not well. So, I was planning to go see him on Wednesday but time was not on my side. And then I received the shocking news,” he said. “Earlier last year, he was admitted to hospital but he recovered. This year he was in good health, and I am really shocked by this news. I am still trying to make sense of it.” Centy has worked with the likes of Pastor Benjamin Dube, Miriam Makeba, Joyous Celebration, Vicky Vilakazi, and Family Factory. Vicky Vilakazi said: “Centy thank you for sharing your talent with us. It saddens me, to see you being celebrated when you can't see and can't hear. I so wish you could hear it yourself that you are called a Legend.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments Musician and his friend, Khanyo Maphumulo, said: “I met him when he joined Family Factory. We were both under Sony Music, but I had my solo career. “He was more of a brother to me. In the music industry, we’ve lost a giant.
