THE City of Cape Town has increased the reward amount for information that can lead to the arrest of the culprits behind their employee's death. Wendy Kloppers (48) was shot inside her car while waiting for the gate at the Delft construction site offices to be opened. The incident happened last Thursday, 16 February, and she was with her colleague at the time. The colleague was rushed to the hospital with some injuries. After the incident, the city announced a R100 000 reward for anyone with information about the incident. On Wednesday, 1 March, Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said they had increased the amount to R1 million with the help of a private donor. “A private donor has approached me with a generous offer to help ramp up the reward to R1 million for information leading to the successful prosecution of those responsible for the murder of a City official at the Delft Symphony Way housing project on 16 February 2023. “We urge those with information to come forward so that we can see justice done for the family of Wendy Kloppers. We also continue to call on the South African Police Service to do whatever it takes to hunt down and find the perpetrators responsible for this violence,” said Hill-Lewis.
