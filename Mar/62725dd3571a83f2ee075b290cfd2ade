Coffin braai stands are not what you might expect at a
friend's party, and they have left Mzansi shocked and horrified. Some laughed, while others said whoever is behind this is
crazy and should be stopped. The coffin braai stands have been making the rounds on
social media leaving people angry. Thembi Gumede on Facebook said people don't know when to
stop. "People are looking at this like it's some joke. It's
sick and should be stopped. We can't normalise such things as if death is
normal," said Thembi on Facebook. Lungile Mndawe also shares the same sentiment. She said
whoever buys this is dead on the inside.  "I don't find this funny at all, it's cringy and I hope
this doesn't become a norm in Mzansi," said Lungile. "People are just drawing bad luck towards themselves
for no reason," she added. Not everyone took this as seriously, Lindani Myeni said
maybe this is a good way of dealing with death or getting used to funerals. "It's honestly not that deep, people need to
relax," said Lindani. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments Sthembiso Mbatha said he actually likes this and would buy
it in a heartbeat if he had money. "This looks cool. At least we won't be looking at a
coffin in grief, it would be a joyous time so look at this with an open
mind," said Sthembiso.
