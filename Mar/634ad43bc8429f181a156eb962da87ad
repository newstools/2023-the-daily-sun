Her uncle (34) told Daily Sun the girl was left with his sister by her mum. "My sister, who is older than my niece's mother, left her when she was asleep and went boozing with her friends. I think that's when the culprit got the opportunity to get into the shack and rape my niece. "My sister returned in the morning at 4am and found my niece already dead. The girl's mother was at church the entire night and she too came in the morning to find that her daughter was no more," he said. He said he suspects the culprit suffocated the girl with a pillow because there were no marks on her neck or bruises on her body. "We didn't find any weapons in the shack, but only found purple slippers. Those slippers belong to the culprit. He left them when he was done with his awful deed. We have hope that we will find him through the slippers," he said. The uncle said their loss has left them shattered and in great pain. "I don't think we will ever forget this. This is the very first time we lose a child in our family and the fact that she was killed in this matter makes it worse," he said. He said they won't blame his sister who left the grade 2 pupil alone because the culprit would have come, even if she was with the girl.
