Monageng told Daily Sun that they intend to indefinite with their action and that the indefinite part will be determined by the employer. "We want to show employer that we as workers are very angry and want more money. The employer owes us Resolution 1 of 2018," he said. Monageng said the employer is constantly increasing the money without consulting the employees, stating that this is a disregard for the negotiation process, in which all parties must sit down and discuss their problems.
