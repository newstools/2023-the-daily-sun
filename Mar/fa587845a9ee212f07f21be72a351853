SINGER Simphiwe Dana has explained the concept behind her song, Umoya. In her Instagram account, she said the song was a tribute to her mother who influenced her singing career. Her post reads as follows: "I wrote this song when my mother passed away to accompany her on her journey. My mother’s influence on my career is so vast that I write a song for her in all my albums. "This one is the most painful I’ve ever had to write - and it gave birth to the MOYA Project. It is as graceful as she was. I don’t know if I will write another song for her any time soon. Enjoy this offering that comes from a wounded heart." ALSO READ: J'Something is up to something! The caption was accompanied by a video clip of her performing the song.

I attended last year's Moya show. This will be my second Moya show. I couldn't not come and experience this magic again this year. Love from eMonti."
