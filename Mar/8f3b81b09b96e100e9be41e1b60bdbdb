The incident happened on Wednesday, 8 March at the SAPS VIP protection unit offices in Bester Brown building in Mbombela, Mpumalanga. Patrick's brother Thami Ngwenyama told Daily Sun people allegedly knew there was conflict between the two men but failed to intervene. "They knew their working relationship was not a healthy one. They failed to resolve the problem. Should they have intervened earlier, this wouldn't have happened. We blame them. They failed them," he said. Thami said Patrick was the only brother he had left. He said because they didn't have time to talk much because of work, Patrick shared about his work frustrations with their cousin.

Patrick even told his wife to take care of their kids and the family," he said. Thami said there was nothing they could do as now the damage had already been done. "We are hurt as a family and still trying to process the loss of our brother. We never knew that he would take such a decision because of his character. He was down to earth, loved his family and respected everyone," he said. Community Safety MEC Vusi Shongwe visited the family on Thursday, 9 March. "Police are also human beings. They can also be angry like you and me. The nearest tool for them is the firearm. It is important that from time to time they go for counselling, get checked if they are still fine and their working environment," he said.
