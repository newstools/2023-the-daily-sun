THE family of slain Nontobeko Msithini was barred from attending the court case of the alleged killer. Velly Thwala appeared in the Barberton Magistrates Court on Friday, 3 March. He is facing a charge of murder. Thwala was arrested after he allegedly killed his 19-year-old lover and stuffed her body in a bag last Sunday. He was allegedly cornered by community members when they saw drops of blood coming from the bag while he was pushing a trolley. When they asked him what was in the bag, he told them he was going to dispose a carcass of his pit bull. The residents then forced him to open the bag and made a shocking discovery.

Speaking to Daily Sun, Nontobeko's aunt Philile Fakude said she was disappointed with the manner in which the police and security guards treated them at court. "Police were pushing us away from attending this matter. Even in his first court appearance we had to use force to enter this court building. We are not happy because they are treating him like a king while we are being treated like nothing. We are the ones who lost a daughter, not him,"she said.
