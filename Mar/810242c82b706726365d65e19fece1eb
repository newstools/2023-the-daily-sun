ANGRY villagers of Justicia Village outside Mkhuhlu in Mpumalanga were up in arms on Monday, 6 March. They were protesting outside the Mkhuhlu Magistrates Court, opposing the bail of a 35-year-old man accused of murder. He allegedly beat up Mathilda Siwele (53) to death with a wooden mortar (used to grind mielies, garlic, onions or spices) at a tavern in Justicia. He was not asked to plead before Magistrate Ayesha Kikia. Public Prosecutor Aurelia Makukule told the court the offence he was facing was serious and fell under Schedule Five. Mathilda's cousin Americo Siwele (42) said they received a call that she had been brutally killed. "We found her collapsed and bleeding on the ground. We thought she had fainted and would come back to life. But police and paramedics certified her dead,” he said. Mathilda and her colleague, who were domestic workers, went to the tavern after work to eat skopo and pap on Thursday, 2 March, at about 3pm. The accused apparently demanded their food.
