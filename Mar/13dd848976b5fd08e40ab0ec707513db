 CITY Power had planned to cut off electricity at Lenasia Station shopping complex and non-paying customers who owe the power utility more than R1,2 billion. But they were forced to abandon their mission after being threatened. Isaac Mangena, spokesman for City Power, said that after consulting with JMPD they decided to abandon the operation. “JMPD advised City Power to abandon the operation at the second business which illegally connected itself, as it became increasingly clear that the safety of the technicians could not be guaranteed with the limited resources the officers had at hand," he said. “City Power previously cut off power at Lens Station shopping complex over the bill which has been outstanding since 2018.” Mangena said they are determined to continue with the disconnection drive in Lenasia, while increasing the police escort. #JoburgUpdates #LensCutOff City Power strongly condemns the actions of a few business owners in Lenasia who threatened our teams during a disconnection operation in the area, when three of our technicians were refused to leave. @CityofJoburgZA @JoburgMPD ^LP pic.twitter.com/3bwokyK0EY   “These drives have been necessitated by the culture of non-payment by some customers in the Lenasia area which has resulted in the SDC collecting low revenues," he said. “City Power is owed over R1,2 billion by customers in the Lenasia supply area. The worrying factor is the number of businesses in the community that are either illegally connected to our network, defaulting on their payments, or bypassing meters.” Mangena said the operation will proceed next week, “We will come back next week Monday or Tuesday to finish off the job.”
