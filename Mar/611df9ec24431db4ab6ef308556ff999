One of the men jumped out and pointed her with a big knife and threatened to finish her off if she tried to scream,” the gogo said. "He then forced her into the car and they drove off with her. My grandaughter said one of the men was talking on the phone, saying they got one child. But the caller rejected the deal saying he had many blood family members in the village.   “They then drove to the cemetery in the village and threw her out of the moving car, leaving her to die there. The men took advantage of the child as she and her siblings are orphaned and live alone. Their mum died some years ago." The girl's sister (18) said they're grateful to a motorist who rescued her and took her home. "She was bleeding with swollen lips and legs. We then rushed her to the hospital," said the sister. Her gogo said they thank God that the thugs didn't rape her. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments Brigadier Selvy Mohlala confirmed the incident.
