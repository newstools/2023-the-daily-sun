 AFTER the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (Nsfas) saw a poster on social media by a Pretoria club called Europa, board members visited the place to talk to the owners. The post on the flyer had read, “NSFAS ingenile”, meaning Nsfas money is in. The post angered many people who said the club was suggesting and encouraging Nsfas students to use the money they received from the financial aid scheme to buy booze. Chairman of the Nsfas board, Ernest Khosa and other board members visited the club on Wednesday, 1 March.

Invoking the Nsfas name and encouraging students to come here and buy alcoholic beverages is wrong,” he said. He said they met the owners and told them that it was illegal.  “Not only is it illegal, but it's also immoral and this can’t be tolerated at all,” he said. “We warned them that if they proceed to do these kinds of things, we will have no option but to take on the necessary steps and legal action,” said Khosa.
