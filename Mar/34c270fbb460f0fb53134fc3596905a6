THE Gauteng Department of Health has warned residents to maintain good hygiene and not to use unpurified sources of water. This follows the confirmation of six cases of cholera and one death in the province recently. One case is of a 19-year-old woman from Emandleni squatter camp in Benoni, Ekurhuleni. The patient was apparently identified by the Outbreak Response Team during contact tracing and social mobilisation activities where more than 1 160 people were reached.

She was referred to hospital for testing and her test results came back positive. She was given treatment and is recovering well. The department said the blame for water sources, such as rivers, boreholes and dams, possibly being contaminated with the Vibrio cholerae bacteria could only be placed at the door of mismanaged municipalities and the Gauteng government. These water sources were also used for irrigating crops and providing livestock with water. People also used these water sources for household purposes because they couldn't access purified water. The department urged people to practise hand hygiene and avoid drinking or preparing food with untreated water from rivers or dams.

Our message was well received, and credit must go to the community leaders and community-based organisations on the ground.”
