NONKU Williams was once scammed of more than half a million rand. And now imposters, who are using her photos on social media to scam people, have reminded her of that 2020 ordeal. The Real Housewives of Durban star told Daily Sun fraudsters anger her as she knows how it feels to be scammed. "This has made me really mad because I’ve also been a victim of this. I  was scammed of R518k in 2020 by a Nigerian man who posed as a white man from the UK and promised I would get R3 million in return. I was shattered,” she said.

"I’d been getting a lot of DMs on my IG page with screenshots from fans asking me if I own a TikTok or Facebook account, to which some I responded by saying no and asking them to please delete and report.

The businesswoman said she hasn't reported the accounts as she doesn't have access to them. "I’m appealing to everyone who gets to read this article to please report them. Delete and let’s expose these culprits," Nonku said. When asked what she's been working on, Nonku said she has a lot on her plate. "I’m done with the shooting of S3 of RHOD but there is a zillion of things I’m busy with from brand collaboration, to name a few. There is something else in the cooking that I believe my fans would be excited about it," she said.
