He also received benefits and hospitality that were not disclosed in respect of his travel from Zurich to Dubai on 2 December 2015 which was paid for by the Guptas. The committee recommended that he must be suspended from his seat in Parliamentary debates for one Parliamentary term. ALSO READ | Health workers' strike leaves patients stranded! This is the harshest penalty by the committee because usually, MPs get a reprimand in the house, a fine of 30 days’ salary, a reduction of salary or allowances for 30 days or the suspension of certain privileges.
