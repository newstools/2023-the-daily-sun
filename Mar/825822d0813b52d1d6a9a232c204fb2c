WITS University Student Representative Council (SRC) has agreed to a ceasefire on the protest against financial exclusion, historical debt and accommodation. The protest is suspended on condition that the institution removes private security from the campus and lifts suspension on students. This announcement was made by SRC deputy president Kamogelo Mabe on Wednesday, 8 March. The protesters want the suspension of SRC president Aphiwe Mnyamana be declared null and void. They vowed to return to the streets of Braamfontein should the institution fail to meet their demands. ALSO READ:Â Tshwane mayor gets his job back! Speaking to Daily Sun outside the grounds of Wits University, Aphiwe said the vice chancellor is distant and does not want to meet them. "We are still waiting for the vice-chancellor to respond. We are not hooligans. We want the chancellor to address our demands," he said. REGISTER TO COMMENT! The suspended president also wants to be included in the talks with the vice-chancellor on their demands. "If the vice-chancellor does not reply to our concerns of accommodation and registration, this university won't proceed to work while the vast majority of our people are suspended. "That one we are clear and unequivocal about, and we are going to state it without any fear of intimidation," Aphiwe said. The university has been making headlines for the past eight days. The students are protesting over financial exclusion, accommodation and historical debts. They want the university to provide 1 000 beds to the current 500 "hardship accommodation beds provision". They also want all students owing up to R150 000 to be allowed to register and the Nsfas cap on-campus accommodation at R45 000 to be removed. They have given the institution 24 hours to listen to their grievances.
