shocked by a half-naked woman on Wednesday, 1 March. The woman was seen wearing only her a G-string. She proudly
showed off her butt for all to see. In the video making rounds on social media,

Such behaviour undermines the dignity of women. A woman of integrity cannot go out in public with her sensitive body parts," she said. The chairwoman of Qholaqhwe Advice Centre, Mapaseka Madonsela, said that most of the women suffer from depression because they are being abused. "We need not criticise them without knowing their real story. We call on South Africans to delete these videos. They perpetuate inhumane behaviour and the integrity of women," she said. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Mmako Mophiring said: "This cannot be public indecency because the woman was half-naked, not naked. She was wearing the same clothes as the women seen on the beaches. This cannot be a police case. Only if she was totally naked, then police can intervene. Otherwise, it will be a harassment."
