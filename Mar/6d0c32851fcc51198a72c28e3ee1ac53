 THE Labour Court has boosted the Department of
Public Service and Administration's (DPSA) position on the current public
service strike. The court ruled on Monday, 6 March that the
interdict issued at the weekend was still enforceable, despite the union's
intention to appeal it. Addressing the media after the court ruling, acting
DPSA Minister, Thulas Nxesi, said the "no work, no pay principle"
will apply to employees embarking on illegal strike action. “Disciplinary action should be taken against those
employees who block entrances and embark on an unlawful strike,” said Nxesi. He said no action will be taken against employees
embarking on peaceful picketing. Nxesi said the government expected employees to
come to work because the strike has been interdicted. You should be SIGNED IN to read comments!  “No leave should be taken during this period of the strike. Careful consideration should be taken when granting leave,” Nxesi said. In court papers, DPSA said there would be "irreparable harm" of the strike was to be allowed to continue because it would affect all public sector services. The National Education, Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) embarked on a strike after rejecting the proposed 4.7 percent salary increase from the government for 2023. Workers are demanding a 10 percent salary increase. ALSO READ - WATCH: Wits students vow to proceed with protest! Union's deputy secretary-general December Mavuso said: “We have been receiving reports in all provinces about the impact the strike has had so far.” Earlier Nehawu said in a statement that they were shocked by this decision to interdict them. "As Nehawu, we reiterate once again that this 6th Administration is hell-bent on destroying collective bargaining, rights of workers and made it as its task to reverse and roll back the gains made by workers over the years," read the statement.
