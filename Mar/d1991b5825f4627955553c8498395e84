"I give them the little I have, but if we have this soup kitchen it will make a big difference. Things are tough out there, food prices are rising, and many people are struggling to make ends meet. We contribute what little we have to make a difference in our kasi,” said gogo Nomawethu.   Mnqasela said it will cost him R500 every time he cooks for the community.
