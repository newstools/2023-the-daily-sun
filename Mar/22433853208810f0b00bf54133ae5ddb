FOR four months, the Khwesine Hostel in Katlehong, Ekurhuleni has been swimming in a pool of kak with an unbearable smell. The kak smelling water flows directly into their yard, leaving residents with no choice but to lock themselves in their rooms even on extremely hot days. Residents said the problem began four months ago when a sewer pipe next to their hostel blocked. ALSO READ- Gatvol CK the DJ guns for King Monada!

Resident Nkosenye Mncube (57) said since the problem began, their lives have been on standstill as they cannot even wash their clothes in the yard because of the bad smell.

The induna of the hostel, Mthakaselwa Mlaba, said the sewer causes a lot of headaches as children are always seen playing in the dirty water. “This isn't only dangerous, but also poses a health risk to them. In the morning, parents have to carry their children on their backs to help them cross the sewer, so they don’t smell like kak in their uniforms,” said Mlaba. Ekurhuleni Municipality spokesman Zweli Dlamini said: “The matter has been reported to the Human Settlements Department for further investigation and intervention.”
