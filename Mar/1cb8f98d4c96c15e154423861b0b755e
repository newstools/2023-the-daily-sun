Police spokesman Captain Frederick Van Wyk said: “Circumstances surrounding the death of a 24-year-old man are under investigation. A murder case was opened for investigation. “According to reports, the deceased was stabbed with a knife and was transported to a nearby medical facility for medical assistance where he succumbed due to the extent of injuries he sustained.” In a statement, SPCA said Jacobs' death is a huge loss to their organisation as he had just signed a contract for permanent employment with the organisation on Wednesday, 1 March. “Dr Jacobs, working under the Supervision of SPCA board member Dr Ayoub Banderker, in the capacity of CCS veterinarian, completed his community service between the Wingfield Animal Health Centre and the Cape of Good Hope SPC,” read the statement. Dr Banderker said he enjoyed supervising Jacobs. “I really enjoyed supervising and working with Dr Jacobs, and I was so proud of him as one of the new generation of Muslim vets,” said Banderker. SPCA CEO Mqabuko Moyo Ndukwana said Dr Jacobs was a dedicated young man. “He was a shining example of what it means to truly care for animals and his loss is not only ours, but also a loss for animal welfare at large. He will be deeply and sorely missed by all of us,” said Ndukwana. Van Wyk said that no arrests have been made and urged anyone with any information about the incident to contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
