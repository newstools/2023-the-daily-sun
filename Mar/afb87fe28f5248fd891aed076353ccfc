Gogo Johanna, who always had visitors every year, will be remembered by her loud laughter. In 2021, she told Daily Sun she knew that she had lived long, so God could take her anytime to join her ancestors. She believed that respecting the elders was one of the ways to grow older. Some of her advice was that one must pray and eat healthily. She said as a young woman, she was told to avoid eating eggs as she would love dating boys.
