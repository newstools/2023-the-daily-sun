LESEGO Moeng has mouthwatering dreams for her business. The 42-year-old entrepreneur from Moruleng outside Rustenburg, North West, is the founder of Belo Dynamics. She started her business two years ago from her backyard by planting chillies. "I didn’t think of it as a business at first. All I had was an idea but the first bottle was so good that my family encouraged me to do more. "The business is growing fast. We get huge support from customers who come back for more,” Moeng said. She plants chillies, processes it into sweet hot/chilli sauce and then supplies them to local markets. REGISTER TO COMMENT! “I have always loved the kitchen. I also plan to start planting more vegetables and selling them,” she said. Lesego said her biggest challenge is climate change and limited space. She encouraged people to start anyway. Don’t wait for bigger land or funding. “Start where you are and use what you have,” Moeng said. ALSO READ: R600m set aside for Covid-19 health staff!
