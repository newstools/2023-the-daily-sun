BUFFALO City Mayor Xola Pakati has been axed by the Eastern Cape ANC. This follows a decision by the ANC Provincial Working Committee (PWC) on Wednesday, 8 March. It is expected that ANC WB Rubusana regional chair and deputy mayor Princess Faku will be elected. Faku had emerged uncontested in the region's fourth elective conference in May 2022.

After the 2021 local elections, an attempt to remove Pakati and replace him with Faku failed because the party favored him over other mayoral candidate. This happened after the ANC made it clear that mayors would be interviewed for their positions. He is the first mayor since the dawn of democracy to finish his term. ANC provincial spokesman Gift Ngqondi said: "An internal organisational consultation process was conducted on this matter and affected staff were informed. The decision has been taken after consideration and assessment by the ANC PWC on the performance of the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality."

The provincial leadership has since submitted three names to national officials at Luthuli House for the purpose of the interview process, after which all other processes will get underway. Buffalo City residents have taken to social media to express their dissatisfaction over Pakati's recall. A resident wrote: “Once the standards that are set by the metro and the municipality are not met, then recall. I think he is a sacrificial lamb.” “I think the ANC set this mayor to fail in order to fire him because the provincial government and the department of Cogta are not doing enough to assist municipalities. Most municipalities in the province are dysfunctional."
