LERATO Nonyane is a woman with a vision and a force to be reckoned with. The 35-year-old is the founder of The Art Of African Beauty hair and nail salon. It's based in her home town of Burgersfort in Limpopo. She told Daily Sun she's always been passionate about job creation.  "By profession, I am a group HR executive and I'm in the renewable energy industry. HR is my first love, and I have over 16 years of experience in my corporate profession. My second love emanated from my passion for job creation, skills development and community upliftment, especially for the youth. That’s how my idea of opening a hair salon at one of the biggest malls in Burgersfort came about,” Lerato said. She said it makes her happy to have created jobs for people in her community.
