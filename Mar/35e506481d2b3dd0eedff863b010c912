THE FAMILY of three siblings who died in a house fire still can’t believe that the ranging flames killed all three at the same time. They said the incident feels like a terrible nightmare. The Simelane siblings, Melokuhle (8), and six-year-old twins Lethokuhle and Khethokuhle from Mtubatuba, north of KZN, died when their home burnt down on Sunday, 26 February.

Their gogo, Zandile Ndlovu (39), told Daily Sun the siblings were sleeping alone in the house as their parents had to go to the clinic. “Their mother is asthmatic, so she had chest pains on that awful day. The father rushed her to the clinic. They left at about 2am and returned just after 3am. They arrived to find that the house burnt down along with their children. They are not taking this well,” she said. She said they were not sure what caused the fire, but suspect load shedding as there was no electricity in the area when the parents left. “So, maybe the electricity returned and caused the fire. There is no other explanation. There was no electricity and no candles were lit while the children were sleeping,” she said. Zandile said they're preparing for the funeral, which will take place on Sunday, 5 March.
