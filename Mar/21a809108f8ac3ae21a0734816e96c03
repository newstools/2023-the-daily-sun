THE Congress of the People (Cope) said they were shocked by what the disgraced former Tshwane mayor Dr Murunwa Makwarela did. During a media briefing at their offices in Joburg, the party members said his actions had brought their name into disrepute. They said it was never their mandate for Makwarela to abandon the DA-led multi-party coalition to team up with the ANC and EFF in the Metro. Cope’s Gauteng Congress Provincial Committee (CPC) chairman, Tom Mofokeng, said Makwarela unilaterally entered into a pact with the ANC and EFF to have himself elected as the mayor without consulting the party which deployed him to council.

I want to put it on record that the two leaders referred to are prominent members of Cope, and they are both suspended for misconduct, awaiting internal disciplinary processes to unfold. Until their cases are heard, they have no right to go around and claim to represent Cope,” he said. Mofokeng said the CPC had resolved to lay criminal charged against Makwarela for defrauding the city and the party.
