 KELEBOGILE Etsane thought his life was over when he sold his soul to nyaope and smoked it for many years. The 36-year-old did not know that one day he would free himself from addiction and venture into business. Today, Kelebogile from Ga-Rankuwa in Tshwane is a clean man. He earns a living by selling pies and motivates people by telling his life story. Kelebogile said he started smoking nyaope in 2001. “My life became a mess after getting hooked into drugs. I started living for it,” he said. He said he was once convicted for house breaking.

He said that he decided to stop smoking in 2014, after getting help from a doctor in Karen Park, Tshwane. "The doctor uses a method where he injects a pill into your butt that flushes out all cravings and drugs in your body. It's very expensive, but it's worth it," he said. He said after he was clean, he thought of doing something to make income. "I wasn't happy with my life. My reputation was gone because of the shame and embarrassment I had caused my family. Knowing myself, I knew I was destined for more than being a junkie." Kelebogile said he stocks pies in bulk and sells them. He said he has established a good relationship with his suppliers. “I sell boxes of pies. A box costs R15,” he said. He said he has been receiving positive feedback from people. “People are supporting my business and it's doing well,” he said.
