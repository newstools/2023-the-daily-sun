AFTER residents heard reports that thugs were taking advantage of potholes to hijack cars, residents decided to act. The people of Akasia, Tshwane, decided the only solution was to buy materials and fill the potholes themselves. Resident Lerato Makwe (36) said: it was a way to show other communities they needed to stand together and address challenges. She said while politicians had failed them, the spirit of ubuntu remained. “We have realised that we can’t wait for the municipality to come and rescue us, or politicians who only come here when it’s time to campaign.” ALSO WATCH: Sinkholes continue to swallow suburb! “We had to do something and we believe this will set an example for other communities to fix their neighbourhoods.” Victoria Kobe, an e-hailer business owner, said she was forced to change tyres almost every week because of the potholes. She said when it rained, it was even worse because drivers didn’t see potholes. REGISTER TO COMMENT! Adam Kobane (46), a homeless man, said the road with potholes is near a bushy area where thugs often hide. “As someone who sleeps on the road, I am scared for my life because wehear gunshots every day, we often see people being robbed and cars being hijacked.” Municipal spokesman Sipho Stuurman said residents should report potholes to their nearest municipal office. and crime should be reported to the Tshwane Metro Police. “However, we have a budget allocated for fixing potholes and maintaining roads.“Akasia has a budget allocated to fix service delivery issues such as potholes,” he said. “We agree that service delivery in the City of Tshwane is not where it should be because of financial difficulties,” he said.
