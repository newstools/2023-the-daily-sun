CLUB and radio DJ Mo Flava has parted ways with Metro FM. The radio jock who was the host of their popular breakfast show, Wake Up On Metro FM, is leaving after he and the station couldn't reach a mutual agreement. Metro FM said  the presenter, whose real name's Moeti Tsiki, has been with the station for eight years. Mo Flava previously presented the afternoon drive show, before going on to successfully host the breakfast show. His last broadcast on the SABC radio station will be on Friday, 10 March. Mo Flava, who will be pursuing other interests, said: “The time has come for me to move on and explore other opportunities. I have spent eight amazing years at Metro FM and I appreciate the opportunity I was given to do top level radio and touch lives." ALSO READ: American group The Temptations in chicken feet drama! "The Metro FM listeners have a special place in my heart. I am looking forward to exploring new opportunities I have lined up in radio where I will continue to express my talent. I am also excited about TV opportunities in the horizon. I’ll also continue to help young people who want to get into radio broadcasting through radio demo workshops,” he said. Kina Nhlengethwa, the station’s business manager, said: “As a station we consider ourselves fortunate to have experienced Mo Flava's brilliance as a seasoned broadcaster.  He has been consistent throughout the years in contributing meaningfully to the Metro FM brand. We wish Mo well in his future endeavors.” Khutso Theledi will continue to hold the fort down as host of the breakfast show until a permanent replacement is confirmed.
