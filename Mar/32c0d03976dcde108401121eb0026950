 THE Mpumalanga Health Department is investigating an incident in which a female doctor was allegedly harassed by Nehawu members while she was working at one of the hospitals. The members are also seen pushing the table the nurse was holding onto. A man can be heard saying that he will stay in the office until the woman deletes the video. The angry man is heard is asking who gave her permission to record them. Later, they pushed the table she was holding onto while pulling her up and down. The doctor is heard saying: "I am going to leave the office,' but the men and women are insisting that she deletes the video first."

"The Department condemns any form of intimidation regardless of where it happened, but it is even more concerning when it happens in a health care facility," he said. Since last week Monday, 6 March, Nehawu members have been striking for salary increase. They are demanding 10% increase. On Sunday, 12 March the union released a statement that they will continue the strike until they get what they want. Nehawu provincial secretary Welcome Mnisi said there must be skeletal arrangements to allow workers to fulfil their duties and allow some members of the community to access health-care services. "Nehawu has issued a media statement to call on all its members to ensure that elements of stoppage of services and disruptions and intimidation, as part of the essential service should not be done," said Mnisi.
