 THE family was asleep when they heard someone digging in their yard at about midnight. When they went outside to check, they found a woman and her child digging. A family representative said when they asked the woman what she was doing, she couldn't respond. So the family called the community of Tembisa in Ekurhuleni to help them deal with the matter as the woman wasn't talking to them.

We still don't understand her excuse for digging in our yard so late at night," she said. The woman is accused of evil deeds and the residents said this wasn’t the first time she was caught doing such. She allegedly told the residents she was instructed by a sangoma to do dig and that what she was doing wouldn't affect the family and instead, she was protecting them. It is said the woman also alleged that this was the only way to remove a tokoloshe that is roaming in the yard. She further asked the family and the community to forgive her. But while the community was busy questioning the woman and threatening to burn her with tyres, a resident reportedly called the cops. And the cops arrived just in time to save the woman from the angry crowd.  REGISTER TO COMMENT Sangoma Mkhulu Ntokozo Mthethwa said according to his bones, this woman used muthi on someone a long time ago, but it turned against her. "Now she keeps going to izangoma who all tell her she has to dig for whatever she can find in people’s yards," said Mkhulu. He advised the affected family to get a sangoma who will cleanse their home and put a protective spell. Tembisa police spokeswoman Sergeant Patricia Mgijima urged the community not to take the law into their own hands. "We always deal with mob attack cases and it never ends good for the community," she said.
