ACTIONSA has parted ways with one of their long-standing members and City of Tshwane councillor, Nkele Molapo. This after they accused Molapo of being responsible for coordinating with some councillors who did not support the multi-party coalition’s decision to support the vote of a new coalition mayor. ActionSA national chairman, Michael Beaumont, said the party senate met on Sunday evening, 12 March and voted to end Molapo's membership. ActionSA’s Senate met last night and voted to terminate the membership of Nkele Molapo for collusion against the multi-party Coalition in the City of Tshwane. https://t.co/WAXByC1eF9  ALSO READ: AYEYE Steenhuisen, Phalatse is coming for you! Beaumont said Molapo also faced a prima facie case, which made it clear that she had intimidated and/or harassed members of their Tshwane Caucus in an attempt to destabilise the party. He further rubbished reports that the reason they cut ties with Molapo was her romantic relationship with their arch enemy and former member, Abel Tau. “We further note reports alleging that senate terminated her membership based solely on her personal relationship which is simply not true. Ms Molapo’s relationship with Mr Tau has been matter of public record for some time. “It is believed that Ms Molapo was involved in gathering information about complaints made against ActionSA members shortly before the information featuring prominently in speeches made by Tau,” said Beaumont.
