AMERICAN music group the Temptations is in South Africa. The group is set to perform in Mzansi in the coming days. But on Tuesday, 28 February, the the City of Ekurhuleni stole the group for a while to introduce them to the kasi lifestyle. Their first stop was at East Rand School of the Arts in Daveyton, where they addressed pupils and advised them about the ups and downs of the music industry. "Our group started at high school, and it grew to what it is today," said group member Lovel Jackson. He advised up-and-coming artists about the dangers of the music industry. "Read and understand the contracts yourself. Take time and even involve lawyers," Jackson said. The group is known for hits such as Papa Was A Rolling Stone, Lady Soul and Soul to Soul. After leaving the East Rand Arts School, they headed to Rhoo Hlatswayo Arts Centre in Daveyton to get a groove of what Mzansi artists have been doing. ALSO READ:Â Sir Elton John is in town! It was all good until they got to the butchery and pub called Butcher 2.0, also based in Daveyton. Chefs went all out to impress them by cooking traditional food which was maotwana (chicken feet), ditlhakwana (cow heels), pap and a lot more African cuisine. But they refused to come out of their tour bus to eat nice African cuisine prepared for them. Persuasions by officials from Ekurhuleni Municipality and their tour manager didn't make them change their minds. REGISTER TO COMMENT! Some fans were left stunned. "This was our way of showing honour and respect to them. And tasting our food couldn't have been better," said a fan. Other people continued to enjoy their food without the group members.
