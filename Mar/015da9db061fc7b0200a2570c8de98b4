PHILANTHROPIST and businesswoman Thobile Nyawo is offering a solution that ordinary citizens can adopt to deal with load shedding. Ordinary citizens, businesses, and civil society organisations have been bearing the impact of load shedding for too long. The regular power cuts have disrupted daily life, affected economic growth, and impacted the livelihoods of millions of people. The situation has become so dire that many people have lost faith in the government and the energy sector. Thobile believes that ordinary people should not have to rely solely on politicians to resolve this issue. Instead, they can take matters into their own hands and explore alternative solutions. She has been actively working on renewable energy solutions that can help South Africans mitigate the impact of load shedding and create a more sustainable future.
