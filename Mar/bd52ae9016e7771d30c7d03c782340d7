THE late media personality, Mark Pilgrim, was described as a loving man who also loved music. This was during his memorial service held at Joburg Country Club on Friday morning, 10 March. It was attended by his family and friends who all took the stage to speak about how Mark had changed each of their lives and what he meant to them. Mark (53) died on Sunday, 5 March after months of struggling with stage 4 lung cancer. The service was opened by playing two of Mark’s favourite songs, and was closed with three of his favourite tracks. Radio presenter Simon Parkinson said Mark was the same person in real life and on TV. ALSO READ : WATCH: Mark Pilgrim memorial service underway! “I met him at Primedia, in the middle of Sandton. Mark was fantastic. I was doing the breakfast show on Saturday and Sunday morning and he was doing the shows after me. We used to spend at least half an hour chatting because he came in earlier. Mark was amazing on air, consistent, he talked to listeners one on one. He was comfortable, what you heard on air and on TV is exactly the person that he was. There was no false Mark Pilgrim. What you saw was what you got,” he said. His fiancée Adrienne Watkins wrote a letter for him. “To my beautiful Mark, this is not goodbye. Just farewell. The last three years have been the most incredible years of my existence. From our very first date, you took my breath away. You whirl-winded yourself into my life and it felt like something out of a famous movie scene,” Adrian said.
