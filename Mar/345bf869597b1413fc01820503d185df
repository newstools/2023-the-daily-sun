 A MAKHI and an alleged soldier were in a party mood and played loud music which disturbed the neighbours who were asleep. But when Yonela Nyangweni (29) and her partner from Crossroads in Cape Town went to  the neighbour's house to ask them to turn down the volume, all hell broke loose. Yonela said after approaching the neighbour, they were attacked by the alleged soldier in the early hours of Saturday morning, 25 February. "The house music they were playing was too loud and it was already after midnight. I went outside and told the lady who was hosting the soldier that she should switch off the music or turn down the volume. It was disturbing my sleep because I was going to work that morning,” said Yonela. ALSO READ: Alostro's road to fame! Yonela said the man didn’t take the request well.

While we were arguing my sisters and my partner came out to see what was happening. My younger sister lit a torch on his face because we were outside and it was dark. He then slapped her, and her phone fell on the ground,” she said. REGISTER TO COMMENT! Yonela said the man then dragged and beat her with an empty beer bottle.
