 MFULENI resident Snethemba Dlulisa (33) is lucky to be
alive. She said it was thanks to amadlozi who sent her to buy eggs
before her shack caught fire. The fire apparently started under the bed at about 10am on
Tuesday, 28 February. "If I didn't go and buy eggs I could have burnt to
death. What I know is that if a fire starts under the bed, it could be vutha. I
thank God and my ancestors that I was outside when it started," she said. She told Daily Sun she had been sleeping when she suddenly
felt the need to go outside.  ALSO READ: Sangoma's 3 day vutha attacks!  "It felt urgent that I must leave the house so I
decided to go and buy some eggs at a nearby spaza shop. On my way back I saw
some smoke coming from my shack,” she said. Snethemba fainted as residents tried to extinguish the
flames, while others assisted her.  REGISTER TO COMMENT!  Resident Sinovuyo Busakwe (40) said: “We are glad Snethemba
was outside when the incident happened.” The unemployed Snethemba now needs help to replace her burnt
furniture. Sangoma Lonwabo Mqungwana (59) from Mbekweni outside Cape
Town said the fire could have been vutha. "However, vutha can only work if she had offended or
fought with someone. A person cannot just send vutha to an innocent person. It
will not work. I cannot say exactly what happened to her house, but she needs
to consult and find out so that her home could be cleansed if the fire was
caused by vutha," he said.
