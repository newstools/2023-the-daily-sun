CONSTANTLY forgiving her partner has led to Betty Makinta losing her teeth. And after he assaulted her, the man left. Now the 47-year-old from Kanana in Hammanskraal in Tshwane has some advice for women: "If he beats you for the first time, leave him because he won't stop doing so.” She said she wants to use her story to warn other women not to let men abuse them. She doesn't have front teeth and has scars all over her body because she thought her abusive partner would stop abusing her.

I would be beaten with a spade, have bricks thrown at me, and be attacked with all sorts of objects. I would sometimes run out of the house half naked, looking for help," she said.  Betty said she opened many cases with the police, but nothing happened. Her former partner was served with protection orders, but he didn't care. Instead, he beat her up some more. "When I met him at a bus stop on Valentine's Day almost 20 years ago, I thought I met my prince. He was so good to me and treated me well until we moved in together. “He would beat me for not opening the door for him quickly when he was drunk and would accuse me of sleeping around. I have now realised that I wasted so many years with him,” said Betty while sobbing. REGISTER TO COMMENT The distraught woman said all she wants is to sell her stand and move on with her life. "It's been over a year since I moved out of my yard. I live with my sister and all I want is to move on and rebuild my life," she said. Police spokeswoman Warrant Officer Margaret Molane said if there's violation of a protection order, the victim should open a case of contravention of protection order and give a statement so that the cops could have a strong case to work on.
