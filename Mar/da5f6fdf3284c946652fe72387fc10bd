When there was no school security, I took charge of locking the classrooms, ensuring that the school was safe. I’m aware of the safety issues related to the surrounding community and have been part of the community watch team that looks after the school during weekends and school holidays,” said Amahle. The store's general manager of sustainability, Andre Nel said: "The Hero Awards programme provides a platform for primary schools to recognise, not only sport and academic achievements, but also learners who are having a positive impact in their community, overcoming hardship, or demonstrating leadership. During the year, each participating primary school is encouraged to reward at least eight learners with a Hero certificate and badge for their positive actions.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments He said at the end of each year, the top heroes are identified and awarded a share of R35 000 shopping vouchers, which they can use to spoil themselves or their families.
