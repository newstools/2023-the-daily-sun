LIBERTY Ndlovu is not an engineer but has managed to make a car that will use solar energy to move. The 25-year-old from Rondebult in Gauteng told Daily Sun that he'll use solar as it doesn't release toxic chemicals to the atmosphere or add to greenhouse gas emissions. He said he is happy to announce that his handmade car is 95% complete. Liberty said it took him less than 10 months to make the car. "The car has a clutch, 4 speed and reverse, gas pedal, brake, brake light, side mirror and can even charge cellphones on it," he said. ALSO READ:  Wife: Let's tlof tlof one last time!
