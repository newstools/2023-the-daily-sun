BLIND soccer coach Dumisani Ntombela (34) believes that against all odds anything is possible. Dumisani lost his eyesight due to cancer at the age of two and his eyes were removed. At a young age he played soccer in the streets of Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni and in 2008, he formed his own club Silver Spears. The team is affiliated with the South African Football Association (Safa) Ekurhuleni Women Regional League. The SunTeam attended Silver Spears' friendly match when they bashed Tigers Ladies FC  4-1 in a game played at the Moseleke Ground in Katlehong on Saturday, 4 March. Dumisani said with the help of her late parents, the team campaigned in the Sasol Women’s League for a few years.

He said: “I had no money to support the team but the love of football and taking care of the youth, especially girls, led me to reopen the club. “In 2021, we started again and I’m looking forward to fulfilling the dream of taking the players to another level.” The soft-spoken coach said when he’s on the touchline, he senses, feels and imagines his players on the field. “I can be able to give instruction to them, and God speaks to me on how to use the talent.” His assistant coach, Thabani Mndebele (34), said he’s the eyes and ears for Dumisani,” Thabani said.
