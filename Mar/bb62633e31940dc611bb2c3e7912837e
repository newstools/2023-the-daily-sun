FORMER SABC1 Zulu news weather presenter, Dicksy Mdlalose, is over the moon about his new gig. Mdlalose spent 12 years working for the public broadcaster. After leaving SABC1 in January, Mdlalose joined Mzansi Wethu IsiZulu news as a weather presenter for Izindaba Zethu. He told SunBuzz that although he is still doing the same job, he is over the moon because Mzansi Wethu news, founded by Newzroom Afrika, gave him a better offer. “I got a better offer at Newzroom Afrika and I told the SABC about it. But unfortunately, they didn’t match that offer due to their financial limitations. “But as the years go by, maybe I will be back at the SABC if they give me the better offer because I love working for them,” he said.

He said he enjoyed the 12 years he spent at the SABC and was time he went for greener pastures.
