TROUBLE keeps piling up for former Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter. The ANC has given him seven working days to report the corruption allegations he made against its members to the police. This deadline is about to lapse on Friday, 10 March. The party said it was now planning a defamation suit against him, while Parliament was planning to call him to appear before it for questioning.

In an explosive TV interview on 21 February, De Ruyter accused ANC members of being part of the group that led to the sabotage at the power utility. Speaking to the media, the party's general-secretary Fikile Mbalula said: “What we cannot accept is to be told that the ANC is corrupt without evidence. The ANC has not sent any of its member to go and do wrongdoing at Eskom or anywhere. “We can’t take responsibility and take this attack on our integrity, which is battered already, by individuals who simply go around doing businesses by their own right but drop the name of the ANC,” he said.

They also said they were preparing to initiate an inquiry into the corruption at the struggling power utility. Scopa chairman Mkhuleko Hlengwa said the allegations De Ruyter made would require them not just to engage him only but also involve the national police commissioner and other agencies he mentioned in his interview “So, my advice is that this does not become a De Ruyter fishing expedition. So he’s not the only one who must appear before the committee,” he said. He said the committee would meet next week to discuss draft terms of reference for what would be Parliament’s second inquiry into corruption at Eskom.
