One of the protesters who refused to be named said: "The alleged suspect is not a violent person. He would not even kill a fly, so the police must not use him as a scapegoat.” Nelson Mandela Bay District commissioner, Major-General Vuyisile Ncata, said: “As the police, we are sure we have arrested the correct person. That is why we managed to bring him to court. People must wait for the courts to decide, because we believe we have done our work and that's why we took some time to solve this case. “I am grateful for the arrest that our task team has made and their effort to ensure a breakthrough in the case. It has strengthened our resolve that we would eventually find the killers so that we are able to establish the motive. Let the outstanding fugitives be found sooner so that the victims' families can find closure."
