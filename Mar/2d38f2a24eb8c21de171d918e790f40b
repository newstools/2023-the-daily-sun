A FAMILY of seven in Ulundi, northern KZN is living in fear. This is because the land they built their house on is sinking, causing their home to crack. As if that's not enough, their home is slowly moving to the nearest river, and they need help to move. The family has already lost three houses and they fear the sinking will continue. Family member Khumbulani Buthelezi (30) told Daily Sun that the sinking started last week after heavy rain, and the sinking is slowly moving their land to the river.

We need to move here as soon as possible before something worse happens. But we don’t have money to do that, and we are asking anyone for help,” he said. Buthelezi said they lived in the area since 2016 and everything was fine until last week. “It seems the land we built our home on will move to the river because of water and mud pressure coming from the mountain. We have lost. If I estimate the value of the houses we lost, it is more than R100 000. Now all we want is to move out fast,” he said. Ward Councillor Mzwandile Sibiya said that the Buthelezi family is located in a very bad place.

Even their neighbours are not safe. They should also move,” he said. He urged other residents not to build their homes next to rivers and mountains. Ulundi Mayor Wilson Ntshangase said they visited the family on Monday, 27 February. “This is a big disaster. It might put people’s lives in danger. We have a Good Samaritan who will build a three-room house in an area where the family will be moved to,” he said.
