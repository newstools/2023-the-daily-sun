THE Eastern Cape Department of Health has launched an investigation into the alleged misconduct of a nurse. This was after the nurse allegedly made unacceptable remarks to a patient (23) and a 19-year-old member of an NGO at the Ntabankulu Community Health Centre. The provincial health spokeswoman, Yonela Dekeda, said: "The patient is reported to have visited the facility on Sunday, 26 February, and allegedly experienced inappropriate treatment while she was in labour. “It is also alleged that a woman from the NGO, who had accompanied the patient, was forced to take pictures of the foetus. The alleged unprofessional behaviour was brought to the attention of the department through a petition from a Ntabankulu-based NGO.” ALSO READ: Skyf break horror - Why nurse was stabbed!
