money. “I don’t have a phone, so I don’t see these videos,” he

because he lost all his family members. “I am alone now, I had a kid but they also took him away
from me, so I am all I have,” he said. He sells combs, needles, threads and toothbrushes on the

entertaining people and making them laugh. I also love music,” he said.
