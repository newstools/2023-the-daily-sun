FORMER Joburg mayor Mpho Phalatse has denied rumours that she is leaving the DA for ActionSA. Phalatse said she has no plans of jumping ship but is instead campaigning for the federal leader at the party’s conference in April. "I'm going to say this, and I have said it many times and I'm going to say it again… I have no plan of leaving the Democratic Alliance. I have no plan of joining ActionSA. Whatever is happening in ActionSA has got nothing to do with me," she said. Phalatse was in the Western Cape on Sunday, 12 March, to support DA candidates in the by-elections and to meet congress delegates to tell them about her offer to be federal leader of the opposition party. She said the allegations of joining another party were nothing but political as they were made at a time when she was focusing on her campaign. ALSO READ: HE BANNA: No mayor again in Tshwane!

ActionSA seems to have leadership trouble as its Gauteng chairman, Bongani Baloyi, is said be on a collision course with leader Herman Mashaba. On Sunday, Mashaba admitted in a statement that his party had a meeting with Baloyi last week in connection with a new proposed role for him. He said the decision "arose from irreconcilable differences on the running of Gauteng provincial structures".
