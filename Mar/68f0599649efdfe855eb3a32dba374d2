MASKANDI artist Phumlani "Imfez'emnyama" Khumalo has angered "his fiance", Ukhozi FM presenter Sabelo "Ntombeningi" Sithole. In December last year, the couple revealed they were engaged to be married. “We became friends in 2019 and fell in love in 2020. We’ve been together since then. Three weeks ago we went for a private photo shoot. The plan was that we would take pictures for Ngenelela, our single. He (Imfezi) came up with the idea of us dressing up like we were getting married so people see that we are a couple without us explaining ourselves to the world. I had no idea he was going to propose,” Ntombeningi had told Daily Sun. Imfez'emnyama had also confirmed they were an item. “We were not ready for this to go out, but it’s been leaked and we figured it was time to make it public. Yes, Ntombeningi and I are together,” he had said. ALSO READ : End of the road for Diep City! But on Wednesday, 1 March, Imfez'emnyama posted a picture of himself with another woman. He wrote: "Mmmh my wife gave me a nice birthday cake. I love you, MaDladla." His followers congratulated him but also asked him about his relationship with Ntombeningi. Daily Sun approached Imfez'emnyama about his relationship with Ntombeningi and he said: "I know a number of people thought I was in a relationship with Ntombeningi. But this was not true. I'm not in a relationship with Ntombeningi and I was never in a relationship with him. We were merely promoting our song and we were raising an awareness around same sex relationships, especially in maskandi music. I am glad we managed to open a debate because we hardly speak about these topics in our circles." You must be SIGNED IN to read comments But Ntombeningi insisted they were an item. "I saw his post and I am still confused about this. Phumlani is my man. As far as I know, we're still engaged to be married. I haven't contacted him because I'm still emotional. I expect him to do the right thing and explain this," said Ntombeningi.
