SISANDA Qwabe-Coutaud has opened up about how she lost six babies to miscarriages. The former Mrs SA contestant said although she has three children now, the journey to motherhood was not easy. On Saturday, 7 January, she shared her story with her Twitter followers, saying her doctors stood by her and gave her hope. Sisanda wrote: “At times, you just need one person who will stop at nothing to change your situation. Dr Muzi Khumalo from Arwyp Medical Centre changed my situation.” Speaking to Daily Sun, Sisanda said when she married her first husband in 2007, she was just 20 and thought having babies would be easy.

Sisanda said everything changed when she went to Dr Khumalo, who studied and went through her family history to discover what the problem was. “After finding the correct diagnosis, we tried again and we conceived our first son, Nqaba. He was born premature at seven months but he was healthy,” she said. Sisanda said whenever she looked at her children, she realised God had done wonders for her. Her message to other women going through the same struggle was not to lose hope as there is light at the end of the tunnel.
