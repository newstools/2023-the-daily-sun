THIS year has started on a good note for two lucky lotto winners who have bagged millions each. A Cape Town player, who won the 21 January Lotto Plus 1 jackpot of R25 million, said he had always had a feeling that he would win some day. According to Ithuba, the ticket was purchased at Pick n Pay from draw number 2301. “The winner chose his numbers manually and found out through the Internet that he was the lucky winner. The winner, who works in the retail sector, says he will continue working, pay off his debt and buy property,” national lottery operator Ithuba said in a statement.

Another winner, a helper also from the Western Cape, won the Lotto jackpot of about R5,4 million from the 14 January draw number 2299. Ithuba reports that the woman was the first lotto multimillionaire in 2023. She shared the news with her daughter, stating that she was planning to buy a bigger house. “I was so excited when I found out I won that I screamed,” said the winner. Ithuba CEO Charmaine Mabuza said: “We congratulate the first Lotto and Lotto Plus 1 multimillionaires for the year. Our winners receive their tax-free winnings between 48 to 72 hours from the day of claiming. We also ensure that a team of financial advisors are on standby to offer advice to all winners of R50 000 and above.”
