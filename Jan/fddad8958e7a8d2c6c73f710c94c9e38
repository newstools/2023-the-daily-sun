ZIBUYILE Ngubeni’s family members are sleeping with one eye open. Zibuyile was beaten to death with a two-pound hammer, allegedly by her fiance and the suspect has allegedly threatened to come back soon. The 26-year-old from Mhlathizi Village in Bergville, KZN was found by her family with hammer wounds to her forehead last Tuesday, 3 January, in the house which she shared with her fiance. The man is nowhere to be found but he is allegedly still making phone calls to Zibuyile’s family, threatening to come back and kill the person who was with Zibuyile in the hotel a few days before he allegedly killed her. Zibuyile’s younger brother, Siyanda (21), said they’re living in fear because the suspect is still at large. “Before my sister was killed, he told us he was going to take his revenge on my sister because she went out with a friend and family members to a hotel. But we never thought she was going to be killed,” he said. Siyanda said he told them he was unhappy that Zibuyile was out with relatives. “We called him to bring my sister back and have a proper meeting to talk about why he was unhappy.

KZN Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has called for the immediate arrest and prosecution of the suspect. “We call on law enforcement agencies to work to find the heartless killer. We are in pain that Ngubeni’s killer is still at large. “As a society, we need to ask ourselves if this is the life we want to live, where criminals get away with murder,” she said. KZN police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Nqobile Gwala said a case of murder was being investigated by Bergville cops. “Police are still searching for the suspect who fled the scene.”
