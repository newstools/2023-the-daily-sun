TWO suspects said they would plead not guilty to charges of being in possession of stolen vehicles and being in the country illegally. Alberto Fundzama (25) and Marcelino Langa (43), both from Mozambique, appeared in the Bushbuckridge Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga on 5 January for a formal bail application. The two were allegedly found in possession of two suspected stolen Toyota Hilux bakkies. Their lawyer Advocate Pieter Naude said: “My clients are innocent and both of them are intending to plead not guilty. They were sent by their friend, who lives in Mozambique, to deliver cars to a friend in Malelane. To prove their innocence, they are willing to lead the police to arrest him there. Langa is not a flight risk because he’s a taxi driver who lives with his wife and three kids in Zola, Soweto.  “Fundzama is an assistant taxi driver and a first-time offender. It’s not true he’s an illegal immigrant. He left his valid passport inside the car and wasn’t given a chance to collect his belongings. He had been living in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni, with his wife and their child for two years.” Prosecutor Aletta Mnisi opposed bail, saying the two were found in possession of stolen property worth over R1 million in the Kruger National Park on Christmas Day and were in the country illegally. The matter was postponed until Wednesday, 11 January, for further investigations.
