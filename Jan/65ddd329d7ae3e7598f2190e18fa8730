A MPUMALANGA man is seeking justice after he was allegedly shot six times by an undercover cop on Tuesday, 3 January. The cop had allegedly mistaken him for an ATM robber. Senzo Mkhabela (27) was with his girlfriend and a friend when the incident happened outside a guest house in Matsulu. While driving to the guest house, they noticed an Audi and bakkie parked at a shopping complex. And while waiting for the gate to open, they saw the bakkie driving past. Minutes later, Senzo heard a knock. “The cop was wearing a balaclava and used his gun to knock on my window. I thought I was being hijacked again and drove away. The cops kept shooting at my car. I managed to stop and we ran for cover,” said Senzo, who sustained injuries on his back and left leg. He was hijacked in 2021 and thought history was repeating itself. They jumped out of the car and hid, then called Tracker. “I went back to the scene and found cops in uniform. My car was riddled with bullets. “Cops said undercover cops were informed there would be a heist and thought we were part of the syndicate,” he said. He said he went to the police station to seek answers but was not helped. Independent Police Investigation Directorate spokeswoman Lizzy Suping said the matter was not reported to them.
