WITH the Nelson Mandela Bay facing severe drought, municipal officials and various denominations gathered to pray for rain. This as the metro’s water woes continue. During the prayer service at Gelvandale Stadium in Gqeberha on Sunday, 29 January, Mayor Retief Odendaal said: “We have done what we could do as the city to prevent a disaster from happening. “The engineers have come up with all sorts of water augmentation and drought mitigation projects but at the end of the day, if it doesn’t rain, we won’t get out of this disaster. At the moment, we have less than a year of water left in our dams. So we feel we need to ask for rain in order for us to get out of this disaster. All our water augmentation and drought mitigation projects are to be completed in March. We want to pray for rain because we believe that it’s the only avenue that will lead to our disaster coming to an end.” ALSO READ:Vandals leave kasi taps dry!
