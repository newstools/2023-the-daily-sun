She said the South African National Parks (SANParks) was not giving the family the necessary support. “My only wish is to find his remains and bury him in a dignified way. This will give me peace and closure,” she said. His son Pat Mashego said: “After the results came back negative, representatives of the park disappeared. They promised to support us until the case was concluded but now they’ve disappeared.” SANParks spokesman Isaac Phaahla said no promises were made to the family. “We have policies and the support we gave them was in line with our policies. We have been making enquiries with the police to find closure,” he said. Police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the skull that was found belonged to a woman. “It means the woman was killed and dumped there but the clothes found on the scene belonged to Mashego,” he said. “We took the docket from the station to the provincial office and another investigating officer will specifically focus on it.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments
