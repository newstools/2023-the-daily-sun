A WITBANK flying squad cop was hospitalised after he was shot by a gang of thugs on Saturday night, 21 January. Police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said two flying squad members who were on a routine patrol offered to help a motorist who had a breakdown. “While rendering assistance, another motorist stopped in the opposite direction close to the members. Members had to attend to a second vehicle to investigate.

Mpumalanga police commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela has strongly condemned the unnecessary attack on cops. “We call for an end to the barbaric attack on police officials. Criminals must understand that the police’s responsibility is to protect and safeguard all the inhabitants of the republic, and not to act against the community,” she said.
