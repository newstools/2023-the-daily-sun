PRINCE Simakade Zulu is not giving up on his mission to dethrone his half-brother King Misuzulu. Prince Simakade, the eldest son of late King Goodwill Zwelithini, has asked the public for donations towards legal fees. He is challenging President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to recognise King Misuzulu as king over him in court. The matter is expected to be heard in the North Gauteng High Court from 31 May to 2 June. According to a letter circulating with his letterhead, he has already spent more than R1 million on legal fees. “We expect the fees to escalate even further. That’s why we request financial support from the nation, big or small, to help us cover legal costs,” the letter reads.

The letter said it was of grave concern that in most legal proceedings against the president, the court ruled against him. “This matter is bigger than any of the parties involved in it. It’s about the protection of our customs and traditions, our rich history and our future, our pride as a people, our sovereignty, our land and the minerals underneath,” the letter read. A poster has been posted to social media with banking details for donations. Daily Sun contacted the prince’s spokesman Prince Mandlakapheli Zulu, who referred queries to Nathi Nxumalo. He confirmed the poster and that the letter were released by Prince Sikamade. The prince challenged the announcement that Misuzulu would succeed their father and the matter escalated to the president. Ramaphosa appointed a mediation panel and later recognised Misuzulu as king.
