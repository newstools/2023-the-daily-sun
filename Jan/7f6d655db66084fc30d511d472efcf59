CONVICTED ex-offender Dimakatso Mokoena (38) from Boiketlo Village in QwaQwa, Free State, is having a hard time finding a decent job after coming out of prison. She was jailed for 18 years after she was arrested at OR Tambo International Airport in 2010 while travelling from Brazil to South Africa when police caught her in possession of drugs. She’s been out of prison for three years but there hasn’t been any progress in her life. Dimakatso told Daily Sun she has been submitting application forms to different companies without success in spite of her marketing management certificate. “I have tried everything to make people understand that I am a different person,” she said. Spokesman for Correctional Services in the Free State and Northern Cape, Josias Ramokoena, said the department assists through initiatives such as stakeholder engagement forums where skills and competencies of parolees may be showcased to potential employers.
