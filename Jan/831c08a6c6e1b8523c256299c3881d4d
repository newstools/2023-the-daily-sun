SHE lives alone and this has led to some neighbours suspecting she wants to steal their men. The situation has now become so bad that some residents have signed a petition to chase her out of the kasi. Lerato Mkhwanazi (33) from Barcelona in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun she had nowhere else to go as she lived in a house that belonged to her parents. She said she had been forced to apply for more than four protection orders against her neighbours. “I’m not free to live in my own home.

Lerato said she didn’t live with her boyfriend because she lived at her parents’ house. “He comes to visit and sometimes sleeps over, but we agreed not to live at my parents’ house,” she said. Lerato said even community patrollers were involved in the harassment.

Patroller commander Jacob Africa said he wasn’t aware of the situation. “This is unacceptable! “We promise to investigate the matter,” he said.
