OPERATIONS at the embattled Ditsobotla Municipality in Lichtenburg, North West, were affected on Wednesday, 4 January. This as disgruntled contract workers, whose contracts were terminated in November, allegedly went on a rampage and destroyed official documents they had collected from the municipal offices. According to Makebe Kgotlhabeng, South African Municipal Workers Union chairman in Ditsobotla, the contract workers stormed into the municipal offices and demanded their last month’s salaries.

Kgotlhabeng said even though they condemn the workers’ actions, the municipality should take full responsibility for what happened. “These workers continued to report for duty during December without any communication from the municipality regarding their contracts. “However, they were told that their contracts were terminated when they demanded their December salaries. There were also allegations that some contract workers were paid their December salaries,” he said. Municipal spokesman Pius Batsile said they investigated the allegations and investigations were underway. “We want to put it on record that no contract workers were paid December salaries,” he said. Meanwhile, MEC for North West Co-operative Governance, Human Settlements and Traditional Affairs Nono Maloyi condemned the incident in Ditsobotla. He said they will bring the police to enforce law and order in Ditsobotla when necessary. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments
