A DRIVER has abandoned a vehicle after running over nine pedestrians, killing three and injuring six in the process. According to Tshwane Emergency Services spokesman deputy chief Charles Mabaso, the driver of a BMW sedan ran over nine pedestrians, killing three female pedestrians and injuring the other six before crashing into a tree. He said the incident happened at about 5.03pm near a traffic circle on 6th and Koch streets at Salvakop in Pretoria on Saturday, 7 January. “Emergency services arrived on the scene to find multiple patients scattered around the scene with the sedan under a partially collapsed tree. The driver of the sedan could not be found at the scene of the accident. Three girls aged around five years were declared dead by paramedics on the scene. Two female patients, of which one is nine months pregnant, were transported to Steve Biko Hospital with moderate to serious injuries. Four other female patients were also transported to hospital with minor to moderate injuries,” said Mabaso. He said the scene was handed over to the South African Polices Services for further handling and investigations. The Emer-G-Med paramedics responded to the same scene of a horrific crash. They discovered twin four-year-old sisters were found killed as well as a third four-year-old little girl. “The driver was not located on the scene and is alleged to have fled following the collision,” said Emer-G-Med paramedics. Gauteng traffic police spokesman Sello Maremane said: “Three children lost their lives following reckless and negligent behaviour by a BMW driver who was allegedly spinning the car.” He said Gauteng traffic police extend their condolences to the families and friends of those who lost their loved ones and wish a speedy recovery to all those who are receiving medical treatment due to injuries sustained in various crashes this festive season.
