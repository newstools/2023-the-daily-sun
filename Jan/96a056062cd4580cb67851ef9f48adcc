AN Indian man is constantly getting stares because of a rare disease. The illness has left his face looking like it’s melting off, but he says he’s still loved and respected. Publication Jam Press reports that people make fun of him and call him names, but that does not bother him. Govardhan Das (52) suffers from neurofibromatosis type 1 – a super rare genetic condition characterised by changes in skin colouring or pigmentation and the growth of tumours along nerves in the skin, brain and other parts of the body. Also known as Von Recklinghausen’s disease, the face-disfiguring disease occurs in 1 in 3 000 to 4 000 people worldwide. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments According to the New York Post, Das didn’t exhibit signs of neurofibromatosis until he was 20 when the tumours appeared up on his face, predominantly affecting the right side. Over the next three decades, the masses ballooned to the point that he lost his right ear, eye and half of his mouth while his nose is grossly inflated. Das’ problems are not merely cosmetic. As a result of the sickness, he struggles to see, eat or speak properly and is in constant pain, claiming that his skin burns and itches whenever he sweats. Worst of it all, there is no cure for the tumours, which are only augmenting with age. Doctors have reportedly refused to operate on Das as they claim the condition is related to his brain, and is therefore impossible to treat.
