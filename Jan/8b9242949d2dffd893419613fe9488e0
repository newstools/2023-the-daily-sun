ASANDISWA Fatyi (39) is forever grateful to a woman who saved her child from a shack fire on New Year’s eve. If it wasn’t for SunHero Nokulunga Sam, Asandiswa from Masiphumelele kasi would have lost her child. Asandiswa said she heard screaming that there was a fire and she opened the door and ran outside. When she wanted to go back into the shack to fetch her two-month-old baby, she met Nokulunga Sam at the door of her shack carrying the baby in her arms. “I’m grateful because she came to my shack at that moment when I needed help. My child is safe and alive because of her,” said Asandiswa. Nokulunga said when the fire broke out, she went from door to door calling to get people out.

Many residents from the area where the fire had destroyed 36 shacks said they were woken up by Nokulunga screaming. Some said they were able to take their IDs because Nokulunga banged their doors as the fire was coming. “She saved many people. Three people died from this fire and I believe that if Nokulunga had not banged doors and screamed, more people would have lost their lives,” said resident Thando Nozombile (36). Police spokesman Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi confirmed that the fire killed three people.
