LIMPOPO cops have arrested seven suspects after they were allegedly found transporting suspected stolen copper cables along the Middeldrift-Koedosdorp road on Monday, 23 January. Cops spokesman Colonel Malesela Ledwaba said they received information about suspects driving a white Ford Ranger bakkie, believed to be responsible for the theft of copper cables from a local farm on Sunday. Ledwaba said they patrolled the area, where the bakkie was spotted and stopped.  “The car, with four men inside, was searched. Police found copper cables and the four could not account for their origin. They were arrested for possession of suspected stolen property,” he said. The owner of the farm arrived at the scene and positively identified the stolen cables.  “Preliminary investigations revealed that the cables were destined to be sold in Northam, and police proceeded to the place. They found a 42-year-old woman, believed to be the buyer, with two other men in possession of various bags containing newly stripped copper cables, bathroom taps and Transnet copper wires,” Ledwaba said. The woman admitted that she was illegally dealing with copper cables, and the three were arrested.
