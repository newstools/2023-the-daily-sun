ABEL Tau has launched a new political party, called United Africans Transformation (UAT). The former Action SA provincial secretary and Tshwane human settlements MMC announced the news at a media briefing in Mamelodi, Tshwane, on Tuesday 17 January. Tau was booted out of the party last year after being accused of attempting to rape a friend’s wife. He said that his relationship with ActionSA ended after what he believed was a staged disciplinary hearing. “The outcomes of the hearing were decided right at the onset. It was like a kangaroo court,” he said. He has filed papers with the North Gauteng High Court over the matter. He said there had been a spate of expulsions from ActionSA. “Once expelled, people must approach the high court and ActionSA knows that not everyone can afford the legal costs,” he said. He said for his new venture, he had teamed up with leaders from all walks of life.

We have the backing of tens of thousands of supporters,” said Tau. “We are a serious player in the political landscape. We are doing this for future generations. Our country will not survive the failures of the current government.” He said that UAT would be based on patriotism, law and order and family values. “My wife is sitting next to me. This is the first organisation that she has been side by side with me,” he said. The party will be contesting the 2024 national and provincial elections. Member Francinah Matlala (47) said: “We need employment, especially for older people.” Earlier in the morning, Tau’s foundation donated groceries and school uniforms to Kutumela Molefi Primary School in Mamelodi,
