WITH Mzansi experiencing regular load shedding, inventor Kagiso Domingos believes he can be the answer to the power outages. The 35-year-old from Ledig Village outside Rustenburg, North West, said he just wants someone to give him a chance to prove his capabilities. “I know I have the wisdom to solve any problem that involves electricity, that’s my passion,” he said. He said it frustrates him every time he hears about break downs at power stations. So he designed an easy-to-carry mobile power station which could come in handy when dealing with the effects of power cuts. The foldable power station has the potential to produce 220 volts of electricity, enough to power up an entire household. What makes this device special is that it converts direct sunlight into electrical energy during the day with the aid of a small solar panel fitted to the case. The energy gets stored into a 12-volt battery and Kagiso is able to convert the stored Direct Current (DC) into Alternating Current (AC), which is conducive for common household electrical appliances. Kagiso said the fact that this device is in no way connected to the grid makes it easier to carry and can even supply electricity when there is no sunshine or at night as it stores the energy for later use. While people struggle with power cuts, he is able to do basic things like charge a phone, power the house or watch TV.
