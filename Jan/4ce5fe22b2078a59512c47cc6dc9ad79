THE Hawks have bust a Cape Town woman over vehicle purchase fraud allegations. It is alleged that the woman and her late husband were involved in a string of fraudulent activities for the past four years. According to Hawks spokeswoman Zinzi Hani, the 44-year-old woman and her husband were both directors of a certain company. They were allegedly using fraudulent documents to purchase vehicles during the period between 2019 to 2023. The husband who was allegedly one of the masterminds in the syndicate was gunned down days before his arrest. “The suspects are reported to have bought vehicles using fraudulent payslips and fake job employment confirmation accompanied with a permanent contract. The suspects managed to get away with numerous bank-approved vehicle loans,” Hani said. HE WAS taken from his home by three men and a woman and bundled into a car. The kidnappers then took Bomba Nesani (31) to Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, where he was questioned and beaten before he was left to die. Luckily, strangers came to his rescue and called an ambulance to take him to hospital.  Over the years, through fraudulent schemes, banks allegedly lost over R4 million to the couple. It is said that their modus operandi was to buy vehicles by applying for hire-purchase finance from banking institutions using fraudulent documents which were submitted via a dealership in targeting the balloon car payments option. The suspects would then change the vehicle ownership from various licensing departments around Gauteng and the Western Cape into their company. You must be SIGNED IN to comment!
