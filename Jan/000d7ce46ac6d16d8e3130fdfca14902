COMMUTERS from Hammans-kraal, Mabopane and Atteridgeville in Tshwane marched to the Department of Transport yesterday, 25 January, to demand answers from Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula. They also wanted the bus company, Northwest Transport Investment (NTI), to be permanently suspended. They said NTI had failed to serve communities as it had challenges such as lack of diesel and struggling to pay drivers and other service providers. Simon Sephokgole (37), organiser of Hammanskraal, Mabopane and Atteridgeville commuters march, said they were tired of empty promises. He said Mbalula promised them in July 2019 to bring 200 new buses to resolve the issue of transport, but there were still no new buses. “We never got any buses, and we are always referred to NTI, which is not fair because they are also failing us,” he said. Simon said that the department must urgently address the problem and NIT must go. “We are heartbroken because government is failing us. “We appeal to the government to appoint a new service provider,” he said. He said commuters must also stop helping NTI by buying diesel and paying toll gates for their buses on their way to work. The commuters said NTI’s contract must not be renewed when it ends in March. Another leader of the commuters, Sonas Mathebula (45), said they buy tickets, but the buses do not show up to ferry them to work. “We end up borrowing money from loan shacks to get other means of transport like taxis,” he said.

The commuters gave the department three working days to respond to their grievances about the lack of buses in their areas.
