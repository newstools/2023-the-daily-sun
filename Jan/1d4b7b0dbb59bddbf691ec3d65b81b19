IT HAS been three years since the Limpopo health department last appointed clinicians on a permanent basis. Since the focus was on Covid-19 for so long, all new appointments were six-months contract posts. But on Wednesday, 4 January, provincial Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba welcomed 170 permanent employees and 1 123 interns to her department. Among the interns are pharmacists, community service workers and medical officers. Ramathuba said the recruitment process took several months. She urged the newly-appointed staff to prioritise treating patients with respect at all times. “We want to appeal to them to understand the sector they have studied for leaves no room for a second chance. “Therefore, whatever we do, let’s try to give our best.” The MEC said the department was able to free up resources by restructuring senior administration posts. “This will assist a lot in stabilising the department, especially because there were uncertainties from our clinicians who were not sure of what would happen when their Covid-19 community service contracts lapsed,” she said. Ramathuba said the new appointments would reduce shortages, which often resulted in burnout among existing staff and could lead to medical negligence. The MEC promised to support the new employees. The next batch of permanent appointments is expected before the end of the financial year, and will include professional nurses. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments
