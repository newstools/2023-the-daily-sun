RESIDENTS have been warned against beating up tsotsis. So the residents in Ekurhuleni have come up with another way to “punish” them. Instead of beating them up, they make them kiss each other as they believe this will bruise their dignity. Some residents have even gone as far as making them kiss each others’ butt holes!

In the latest incident on 1 January, residents of Daveyton in Ekurhuleni caught two men who were accused of stealing a TV. They caught them and made them kiss. Community leader David Mngwevu told Daily Sun he understands why residents have taken this route. “Since people aren’t allowed to take the law into their own hands, this is the best way to punish them,” he said. Resident Gugulethu Phakade said she loves the idea and hopes it’ll scare off other criminals. Another incident happened in Katlehong on 31 December. The residents found two men who had robbed someone of their cellphone. “They refused to kiss and were moered,” Gugulethu said. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo advised residents not to take the law into their own hands as this will land them in jail. “If residents catch a suspect, just report them to the police,” he said.
