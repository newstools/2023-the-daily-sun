THE family of the cop who was gunned down together with his family wants those behind the killings to explain the reason for them. Warrant Officer Sinegugu Mavundla (49), fiancee Khanyisile Mthulisi (39) and their children, Siyamthanda Mthulisi (10) and Thando Mavundla (17) died during the attack on Saturday, 21 January. Another member was injured. Sinegugu’s brother, Bhekisisa, said they wanted to know why the family was killed. He said his brother was a good cop who didn’t deserve to be killed in such a brutal manner. “I hope the suspects can be found soon so we can understand why this happened,” he said. Sinegugu was described by his colleagues and many in the community as a respected and dedicated public servant. Police Minister Bheki Cele, his deputy Cassel Mathale, and SAPS management visited the family on Tuesday. Cele assured them, as well as the community, that this crime would not go unpunished.

Ours as law enforcement is to ensure that a thorough job is done during the investigation, and that the results bring the affected families, community and the nation some closure,” he added. Following the visit, the ministry called on detectives assigned to investigate the shooting to work with agility to find the killers. While the motive is yet to be confirmed, investigators from the Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigations are following up on leads. Sinegugu and his family will be laid to rest over the weekend.
