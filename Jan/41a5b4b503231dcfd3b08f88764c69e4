MXOLISI Dlamini is hustling to make sure his family doesn’t go to bed on empty stomachs. After the Covid-19 pandemic hit Mzansi’s economy hard, he came up with a plan to make toy cars with wire, wooden boards and plastic pipes.

Mxolisi said he started making and selling the cars during the first week of hard lockdown. “We were really starving by then and had nothing to eat. “I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw the support from my neighbours. They placed many orders to keep their bored kids busy at home,” he said. “Today, we can make up to R900 a day, especially on a busy week. But we need more space. I want to train people to do this so that they can get out of poverty,” he said. His wife Tryphina Molobela (56) said meeting Mxolisi was a blessing in disguise.
