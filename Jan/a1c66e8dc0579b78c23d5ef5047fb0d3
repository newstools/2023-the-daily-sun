THE Commission for Gender Equality (CGE) says it has noted the disturbing allegations of labour brokers demanding sexual favours from vulnerable jobseekers in return for job placements at liquor companies Heineken and Distell. In a statement, according to CGE spokesman Javu Baloyi, this information emerged during the hearing conducted by the Competition Tribunal on the proposed acquisition of Distell by Heineken. “A non-profit organisation representing vulnerable workers told the hearing that supervisors from labour brokers allegedly took advantage of temporary workers at the two companies’ operations, by demanding sex for jobs,” Baloyi said.

It is the duty of employers, in both the public and private sectors, to ensure maximum protection of the rights of workers through policies and stringent monitoring systems,” he added. “The CGE would like to encourage employers to develop sexual harassment policies and implement procedures allowing workers to report sexual misconduct.” A spokesperson for HEINEKEN said: ‘We are concerned to hear
such disturbing allegations. At HEINEKEN, we are committed to conducting
business with integrity and fairness, with respect for people, the law, and our
values. We also seek to do business with partners and suppliers who share our
values and commitment to responsible business conduct. Where we find evidence
of conduct that does not meet our standards we will investigate and act
accordingly.  We have already committed
to a full investigation of the allegations and will of course work in full
cooperation and transparency with the Commission for Gender Equality and all
other relevant stakeholders.’
