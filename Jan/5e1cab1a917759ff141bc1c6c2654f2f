A WOMAN desperately wants to be a wife and have many kids, but she’s never had a boyfriend who has stayed for more than two months. She told Daily Sun recently she thought things would be better and she even fell pregnant after a prophet gave her holy water, but three months later he was gone. The child is now seven years old and the father wants nothing to do with the boy. The 42-year-old woman from Chiawelo in Soweto said she never thought short relationships were a problem but then she realised the years were going by and she had nobody to love. “Sangomas told me someone put muthi on my mum’s grave to block my love life and my luck,” she said. Her mum died when she was 23, so she has no idea who wants her to suffer like this. “I wasn’t even working and my mum didn’t have money that she could leave for me when she died. She left me her house because I was her only child,” she said. She said she’s met amazing men but they all slip away. Some have remained her friends but some simply vanished. “I don’t ask men for money and I know how to treat a man but somehow they just leave,” she said. Daily Sun spoke to her cousin (39) who said what her relative is going through hurts her as well but she also can’t help her. “I really don’t know what to do,” she said. One of the exes who’s now a friend said he doesn’t know why he didn’t want to be with her anymore. “Now that I know the cause of her problem, I understand but I still don’t see us fixing things,” he said. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! “She really knows how to treat a man and that’s why I didn’t even understand why I couldn’t be with her.” Sangoma gogo Lesedi Mokoena said the mum’s grave is the root of the problem. “Some work will have to be done on the grave. This won’t only help her daughter but it will also free her spirit from being used,” she said.
