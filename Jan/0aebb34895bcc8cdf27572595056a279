ROMAIN Folz nearly got a heart attack when AmaZulu conceded a last-minute gasp to share DStv Premiership points with Richards Bay at the King Zwelithini Stadium on Sunday. He was left ruing all opportunities they created, which ultimately allowed Katlego Maphathe smashing a late equaliser, which left Folz with a sour face and kicking his heels. “It’s unfortunate,” said Folz. “I believe we were the best team on the day. We deserved to win. “We could have scored more goals... we created chances and we were good technically, very disciplined.” This was Folz’s seventh draw with AmaZulu in the Premiership.
