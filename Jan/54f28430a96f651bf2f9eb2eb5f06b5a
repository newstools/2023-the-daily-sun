MAN was hit by a train in Naledi, Soweto, at around 9am on Wednesday, 11 January. Daily Sun spoke to a few people who were at the scene and those who live nearby. A resident said he suspects the man committed suicide because he heard an abnormally loud beep from the train coming from far. “It made a really loud sound for long and I wondered what could be happening. Even if you were attempting to cross the railway at the time, there’s no way one couldn’t hear that loud sound,” he said. He also told Daily Sun he saw the body but doesn’t know who that man might be. He sent his condolence to the family.   Another resident, who heard the train’s beeping sound, said it was so loud that there was no way the man didn’t hear it. “I even peeped to see what was happening and a few minutes after that, I heard a loud sound,” she said.  She said she was not the only one who suspected that something was terribly wrong because when she rushed outside, other residents were already at the scene.
