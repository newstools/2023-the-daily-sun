It was truly men against boys at the Orlando Stadium on Sunday as Orlando Pirates swatted aside Stellenbosch FC 4-1 0 in a DStv Premiership encounter.The Buccaneers were ruthless, especially in front of goal, as they put four past a hapless Stellies outfit in front of a decent home crowd in Soweto on a hot Sunday afternoon.The goals were coming from everywhere with four different players getting on the scoresheet for Jose Riveiro’s side on their way to a comfortable victory, their second on the spin.Midfielder Thabang Monare, skipper Innocent Maela, striker Kermit Erasmus as well as midfield maestro Ndabayithethwa Ndlondlo all registered their names on the scoresheet for Pirates.Mervin Boji, meanwhile, came from the bench to score what would be a consolation goal for the team from the Cape Winelands, with Pirates simply too strong on the day.The Soweto giants, who struggled for goals at some point this season, seem to have found their scoring boots of late with goals coming from all over the pitch in a rapid rate.In their last two matches alone, the mighty Buccaneers have scored no less than seven goals while conceding just two and seem to be slowly building me momentum.Their win over Stellies leaves the Sea Robbers in fourth place on the Premiership standings with 25 points from their 17 matches so far, 21 points adrift of runaway log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns.Pirates have played a game less than defending champions Downs and will feel they are still in with a slim chance of putting pressure on the Tshwane giants, should they falter at some point.For Stellies, the result meant their struggles of late continue as they fell into the relegation zone having only managed to pick up 17 points from 18 matches so far.Steve Barker’s charges are enduring a tough period having now gone nine matches without a win, a run that include five defeats and four draws.They will be hoping to break that miserable run when they face Cape Town City in a Western Cape derby at the Danie Craven Stadium on Friday (7.30pm).Pirates, meanwhile, will be out to maintain their newfound fine form when they do battle against Marumo Gallants at the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg on Saturday (8pm).
