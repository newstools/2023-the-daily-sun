LAST year, some grade 12 pupils from Phandimfundo Secondary School in Daveyton missed their Economics paper 1 after allegedly being turned away by their principal. The principal allegedly told them not to report for exams because of the planned protest. And, it later turned out that the principal had lied. This saw principal Rothi Makhubela being taken for a hearing while 53 matriculants wrote the missed paper on 7 December. This morning, Daily Sun spoke with some of them, and Mduduzi Mnyakeni said he had been having some difficulty sleeping. “I’m glad the wait is over and I made it,” he said. Mzwakhe Skhosana said he was happy to see himself in the paper.

The two pupils say they were looking forward to furthering their studies. Daily Sun went to the school, but the principal did not want to comment. The school’s matric pass rate is 66,2%
