TV viewers have given Moja Love’s show Sizoktholaa thumbs up. Among the viewers is Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi. Endorsing the show, Lesufi said that it deserves sponsorship from the government. Sizokthola premiered on Moja Love (DStv channel 157) on Sunday at 9.30pm. Viewers saw the host Xolani Khumalo and cops invading a drug den in Sunnyside, Tshwane. They confronted the alleged drug dealers and drugs and money were found. ALSO READ : Why Makhadzi and Master KG broke up! One alleged drug dealer, who is a foreign national, tried to explain to Xolani and the crew that he was innocent. But things took a turn when Xolani asked for the papers proving that he is in Mzansi legally. It turned out that his papers had expired and that he was previously detained in China for being there illegally. Lesufi tweeted that Mzansi needed such content on TV. “Well done @MojaLove #Sizokthola. Drugs are destroying our nation. This is the content we, as the government, must support,” tweeted Lesufi. Responding to a tweet, which called for the show’s support, Lesufi said he has communicated with his office. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments “I fully agree. I’ve since instructed my communication and marketing team to immediately sponsor this show. This is not television, but the nation’s call,” replied Lesufi.
