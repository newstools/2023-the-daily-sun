THE South African Police Service has welcomed new members to their Special Task Force (STF) unit, also known as Amabherete in the kasis. In an auspicious event, 11 newly trained STF members stood in a parade where they received their wings from the national police commissioner General Fannie Masemola at the Police Academy in Pretoria West on Thursday, 12 January. Also standing in the parade were an additional 10 STF members who received their operators badges after undergoing a two-year probation period, during which they were already serving as members of the elite unit. The members, including a 31-year-old woman, have undergone and successfully completed the 36th two-year STF selection training programme. National police spokeswoman Brigadier Athlenda Mathe said the new members are joining a highly specialised unit whose members are responsible for only responding to high-risk incidents which include hostage incidents, search and rescue missions, as well as specialised operations support.  Mathe said the STF operators badge is the symbol of a qualified hostage release and counter terrorism operator. She added that the STF parachute wings are worn on the left side of the chest and signify that the recipient has been trained at a high level of weapon proficiency, hostage release tactics and the ability to deploy operationally by parachute into all terrains. General Masemola congratulated and welcomed the members into the force.
