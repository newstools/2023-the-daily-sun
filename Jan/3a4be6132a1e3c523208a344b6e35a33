BLOCKED storm water drains and roads covered in potholes are making life a nightmare for motorists. Emfuleni, in the Vaal, already has a serious problem with potholes but recent heavy rain has worsened the situation, forcing motorists to swerve to dodge them. When it rains, roads flood and it becomes difficult to even walk on some streets. The flood water then mixes with raw sewage that runs out of blocked manholes. Mampe Motloung, a motorist from Evaton, told Daily Sun their cars suffered damage whenever they drove on the roads. She said only large vehicles were able to drive over the potholes.

We often ask ourselves why we pay rates and taxes if our complaints are not attended to,” she said. Taxi driver Sipho Ngwenya said cars suffered punctures whenever it rained as they drove into potholes or hit the side of drains. The municipality’s acting spokesman Mojalefa Radebe said they noted the challenges faced by motorist and priority would be given to the worst roads for the coming Municipal Infrastructure Grant funding. “The municipality remains committed to solving all service delivery challenges facing our region,” he said.
