IZANGOMA recently gathered in the streets of Nyanga, Cape Town, to celebrate Thandiswa Dumakude’s graduation. There was dancing and feasting as residents also joined in to celebrate the 36-year-old’s achievement. Thandiswa, who has been a thwasa for two years, told Daily Sun her journey to becoming a sangoma hadn’t been easy. She said she first tried it in 2012 and quit, but amadlozi guided her back to her calling. “Nothing was working out in my life and I realised what I was running away from was the key to my success. “I then decided to listen to my ancestors,” she said. “When you thwasa, you stop everything and focus on that. REGISTER TO COMMENT! “It’s not something you can do part-time.” Gobela Shiela Nomfulana (60) said when a person failed at their first attempt, it was usually because it wasn’t the right time. “Now it’s her time and everything went according to plan,” she said. Thandiswa said her ancestors showed her gobela Shiela in her dreams. She said when she visited her gobela, she said she had been waiting for her as she had also had dreams about Thandiswa. “Both our ancestors communicated and agreed that I was to be her gobela. I walked with her on this journey,” said Shiela. “It was not an easy one, but today we are here celebrating her success.” The gobela urged Thandiswa not to behave like other izangoma who are always drunk because that will destroy her gift. “Alcohol has destroyed many people, including izangoma. I don’t want to see you joining that band. It’s not good for you, especially if you want to go far in your journey,” she said.
