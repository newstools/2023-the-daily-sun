ELDORADO Park cops have arrested a 21-year-old man for being in possession of dagga in Freedom Park. According to police spokeswoman Sergeant Roxanne Gibb, this happened after a tip-off. Gibb said the police followed up on the information, resulting in them finding the suspect in possession of 18 big bags and seven small plastics of dagga. The street value and weight of the dagga is currently unknown, and two more men were later arrested for alleged bribery.
