 FORMER ANC secretary general Ace Magashule is expected to appear in the Bloemfontein High Court on Friday, 20 January. Magashule and his 15 co-accused faces over 70 charges, including theft, corruption, and money laundering relating to an R255 million tender in 2014 to remove asbestos from houses in the Free State. The state alleges that Magashule had executive authority over the tender as he was the premier at the time. However, he has maintained he was innocent. “I must go free. I never stole any money. Not even a cent,” he said during his previous experience in September. His lawyer, Advocate Laurence Hodes, told the court that they were petitioning the Supreme Court of Appeal over the use of Zondo Commission evidence against them.  Hodes also said he wanted his client to be trialed separately from other accused. Magashule, who is a staunch Zuma supporter, failed to return to the ANC top seven at the party's 55th national conference held in Nasrec Convention Centre outside Joburg last month. Lawyers representing the other accused told the court that the matter should be removed from the roll until the state was ready. They said the case was costly for their clients. Recently expelled ANC Carl Niehaus said he would be in court to support his friend. Niehaus was in the South Gauteng High Court on Thursday to support former President Jacob Zuma in his private prosecution matter against President Cyril Ramaphosa.
