THE battle lines have be drawn as former president Jacob Zuma takes President Cyril Ramaphosa to court over the leakage of his medical records. Zuma, on the eve of the start of the ANC national conference last month, revealed that he was privately prosecuting Ramaphosa for failing to intervene in his complaint against senior prosecutor Advocate Billy Downer. Zuma is also privately prosecuting Downer, who he alleged leaked his medical records to News24 journalist Karyn Maughan. Maughan is also co-accused in the public prosecution. Ramaphosa has labelled the charges as spurious, unfounded and an abuse of the legal process.

The matter to dismiss the charges was set down for Tuesday, 10 January, but the Jacob Zuma Foundation has now revealed that the matter will instead be heard on Thursday. The foundation spokesman, Mzwanele Manyi, said contrary to media reports that Zuma has missed the deadline to file the opposing affidavits, the answering affidavits are supposed to be filed by Tuesday. “So, the screaming headlines that ‘Zuma missed the deadline’ are fake news. The deadline that counts is the one set by the judge,” said Manyi. He added that all parties have been instructed to file affidavits by Wednesday, before the hearing on Thursday.
