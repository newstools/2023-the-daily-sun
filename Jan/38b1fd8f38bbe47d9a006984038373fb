A THIRD suspect has been arrested and charged with the murder of ANC councillor Sbonelo Ntshangase and two others. The 48-year-old was found in KwaZulu-Natal and taken in for questioning on Tuesday, 17 January. He was charged on Wednesday, and is expected to appear in the Mkhondo Magistrates Court on Thursday. Mpumalanga police boss Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela said the intention of arresting the suspects was to get to the bottom of the killings. “We can safely say at an extent that these cases are going to be linked as they are all arrested for the same murder,” she said. On Tuesday, former Mkhondo Local Municipality mayor Vusi Motha and Wellington Sangweni appeared before the same court on charges of unlicensed firearm, fraud as well as contravention of the control of the firearm and Private Security Industry Regulation Authority act. The two are also linked to the murder. Police said they confiscated an automatic rifle that would be taken for ballistics. The two are expected to apply for bail next Tuesday, 24 January.  Ntshangase, Sizwe Mbingo and Sandile Khumalo were gunned down last Friday, 13 January, at a certain yard in the Longhomes township, Mkhondo. According to the police, three men appeared in the yard and fired shots, killing the three. ANC Secretary General Fikile Mbalula, who was visiting the area, commended cops for the arrests, adding that they could not be intimidated by thugs. “We are not shaken. We commend cops for their sterling work. We were informed that more arrests are imminent. We must step the authority of the state. It must be known that the ANC is the ruling party,” he said.
