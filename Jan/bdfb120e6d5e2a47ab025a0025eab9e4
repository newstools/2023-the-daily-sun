THE funeral arrangements for Mampintsha’s mother Zamanguni Gumede (64) are underway. The memorial service will be held on Friday, 20 January, at KwaMashu L Hall in Durban, KZN. She will be laid to rest on Saturday, 21 January, after a service held at the same hall. Spokeswoman for the Gumede family, Balungile Gumede said: “The funeral and memorial service will take place here at KwaMashu because she lived most of her life here. Her neighbours and friends are here. She was a people’s person, so we’re expecting a lot of people.” ALSO READ : Focalistic hits big milestone! “We decided to hold the memorial service in the afternoon because we want to accommodate everyone.
