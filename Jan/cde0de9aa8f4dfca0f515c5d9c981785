The Limpopo outfit has been struggling this season as they currently lying at the bottom of the DStv Ptemiership with 14 points from 17 matches.  Perfomance wise, their not as bad as their position on the table, lack of killer instinct upfront has been their major problem.

Moseamedi joined Stellies from Maritzburg United at the beginning of last season. He made 32 appearances and only managed to score six goals before being released by the winel;ands based outfit last month.
