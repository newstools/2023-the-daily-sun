CABLE thieves, who normally target Eskom and Metrorail cables, have now started terrorising kasi residents. More than 15 households in block 6 of Philippi, Cape Town, woke up on the morning of Sunday, 15 January without power and found the cables connecting their shacks to the electricity box had been stolen. Six cables were stolen while others were left hanging, posing a danger to kids who play in the area. Community leader Rose Khaile said she was left shaken by the incident. “We woke up to this mess. We have never encountered a problem like this here before. It left us shocked,” she said. Nomfuneko Mbana (53) said the thieves even took cables from the shack of a woman living with a disability. “She’s now forced to cook at neighbours’ homes. It’s scary because these cable thieves’ actions could lead to our children being electrocuted,” she said. “When they steal the cables, they leave them hanging everywhere.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments The City of Cape Town said non-stop load-shedding at high stages leaves infrastructure vulnerable. “The city monitors hot spot areas, but residents are encouraged to report any incidents of theft, vandalism and damage to infrastructure to the city and the South African Police Service,” the city said in a statement.
