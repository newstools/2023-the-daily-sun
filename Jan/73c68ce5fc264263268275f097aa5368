HE jokingly took a girl’s R20 note, but little did he know this would end badly for him. Now Mondli Tikwane can’t hear in one ear after he was poured with acid. On top of that, his mum was allegedly beaten up by the 17-year-old girl’s mother. Mondli (20) told Daily Sun he met the girl on 1 January on his way to the shops, and asked her to take a photo of him. “I saw the girl had R20 and took it to tease her. When I gave it back, she was angry and told me she no longer wanted it,” he said. Mondli from extension 6B in Orange Farm said minutes later, the girl returned with her mum, a Correctional Services officer. “I tried to give the girl her R20 back, but she refused. Her mother had a bottle of something that looked like water, which she handed to her daughter. She told her to pour it on my face. I can no longer hear in my right ear.” His mum Motshidisi (63) rushed him to Stretford Clinic, but they followed them. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments “They said they wanted to finish my son. We had an argument and they assaulted me,” she said, adding that the mum told her she would not be arrested as her boyfriend was a detective. When she opened a case at Orange Farm Police Station, she was referred to Vereeniging Magistrates Court for a protection order. The woman’s brother said even the family was scared of her as she was proud to be dating a detective. Another victim (33) told Daily Sun she had been in hiding for about eight months after the woman and her daughter assaulted her. “She pointed a gun at me. When I reported this, I was referred to court for a peace letter. I did but she never attended. I went back to the station and opened a case.” She said she refused to stop dating her brother, leading to her allegedly getting stabbed. Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said a case of assault was opened against a suspect (girl). She appeared in court on 5 January, and the case was postponed to 19 January.
