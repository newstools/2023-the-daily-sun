IT’S all systems go for the resumption of the ANC’s 55th elective conference and the party’s 111th birthday celebration. On Tuesday, 3 January, newly-elected secretary-general Fikile Mbalula briefed the media about preparations for the event, set to taking place from 4 to 8 January in Mangaung, Free State. Speaking about the adjourned conference, Mbalula said it will conclude on 6 January with a conference declaration. The conference was postponed last month due to a prolonged registration process on the first day. He said only issues such as policy adoptions will be dealt with when the conference continues tomorrow. When asked whether the ongoing Phala Phala scandal will be discussed, he said it won’t be discussed. Also, he said the matter of five MPs, including Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, voting against the president on the report, will not be discussed and was being dealt with by the disciplinary committee.

Yes, we have vacant posts and that’s why he needs to think carefully.” Speaking about the anniversary celebration, Mbalula said issues that were flagged with the stadium were cleared. He said the ANC will also host a golf day and gala dinner for fund-raising purposes on 7 January. “As is tradition, several build-up activities will be conducted as part of the 111th anniversary celebrations. “These activities will include a revolutionary pilgrimage led by the national officials in the form of laying wreathes at various grave sites of former presidents of the ANC and interactions with communities,” he said.
