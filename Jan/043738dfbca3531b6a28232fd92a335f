RESIDENTS of Evaton West in the Vaal protested on New Year’s Day to show their unhappiness about a giant pothole in their area. “We did the same thing in October 2021 and before the local government elections in 2016, to highlight our daily struggle with the road,” Lebohang Khambule (40) told Daily Sun. “We have been complaining about it to the Emfuleni Local Municipality and the road has never been fixed.” Lebohang said taxis drop them off at the Golden Highway because no taxi or a car could take the chance by using the road. “Even buses are swallowed by this gigantic pothole.” She told Daily Sun that when it rains, the water level is good for swimming. “We decided to welcome in the New Year at the giant pothole, bringing our cooler boxes and drinks,” she said.  Lebohang said they’re forced to walk long distance to catch taxis at the Golden Highway. At times they are forced to hire small cars to the taxis to get to towns or malls as the road is a swimming pool. Tankiso Baloi, a resident who lives on the street, told the SunTeam he’s forced to park his car at his brother’s house in the morning to get a taxi to go to work. Tankiso said they’ve reported the problem to the municipality many times, but nothing happened. Emfuleni local municipality spokesman Makhosonke Sangweni said the municipality would contact the roads department. “The road will be fixed,” he said. “When it rains we fear that our kids might drown,” said Baloi.
