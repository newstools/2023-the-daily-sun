A BUS driver was lucky to escape uninjured after he fell asleep and drove into the oncoming lane on Wednesday. Western Cape MMC for Safety and Security Jean-Pierre Smith said the incident happened just after the R300 highway. The incident was picked up on the camera by the freeway management staff. Speaking about the incident on Wednesday, Smith said the bus was not carrying passengers at the time of the incident. “Early this morning (Wednesday), a bus entering Cape Town had a close escape after the driver fell asleep at the wheel. The bus drove over the centre median, skidding across the oncoming lanes and ended on the shoulder of the outgoing lanes, partially blocking the left lane just after the R300 freeway,” said Smith.

He urged drivers to pay attention to their bodies and not to ignore it when they feel tired, and should get a rest. “Such incidents become a stern reminder: after all the various pitfalls and risks associated with commuting, driver fatigue is perhaps the easiest to rectify but sadly most often ignored. Wake up and listen to the signs of your body,” he said. Smith said the bus was recovered and towed away. While releasing festive season road incident statistics, Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula said the majority of incidents and fatalities on the road were as a result of human errors. “Human factors remain a principal driver of fatalities on our roads, accounting for 87% of all crashes. These are followed by road and environmental factors at 8%, with vehicle factors at 5%,” the minister said.
