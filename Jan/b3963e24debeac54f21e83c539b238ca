“WE ARE going to show them flames.” These were the words of former MK Military Veterans’ Association spokesman Carl Niehaus. Niehaus took to social media on Monday, 2 January to announce that he was going to launch and build what he called a broad civil society and political movement to work towards the full liberation of the people of Mzansi. He said people needed to remember the ideals that made them join the ANC. “We saw the ANC as the right vehicle and the right instrument to achieve those ideals and for a long time, that was true but historically it as ended,” he said.

Rest assured, the struggle continues,” he said. Niehaus said this year, he’ll continue to build a political movement that will work for his people. He said he was giving notice to President Cyril Ramaphosa and his sell-outs in the dead ANC that they no longer represented the ideals of the ANC and those who served time on Robben Island. “We are going to take them on. We are not taking them on because we hate them personally. We take them on because they have betrayed the liberation struggle. They don’t deserve to be called the leaders of the ANC,” he said. Niehaus said he will fight the current leadership, but not the ideals of the ANC. Last month, Niehaus was expelled from the ANC over comments he made about former president Jacob Zuma’s contempt of court sentencing in 2021. The National Disciplinary Committee of the ANC found him guilty of six counts of misconduct for bringing the party into disrepute. A few days later, he announced he was resigning from the party.
