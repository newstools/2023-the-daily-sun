A COP and his family were entering their driveway when they were met by a hail of bullets on Saturday, 21 January. It appears that the gunmen planned the attack in Nzimakwe in Port Edward, KZN, carefully as the family had no chance to escape. Sinegugu Mavundla (49), his partner Khanyisile Mthuli (39), daughter Siyamthanda Mthuli (10) and son Thando Mavundla (17) were all killed while one member of the family was seriously injured. Mavundla was entering his driveway in a white Volvo with his family when several shots were fired towards the car. All the victims had multiple gunshot wounds and the driver’s side and back right passenger were riddled with bullets.
