WHEN Ngizwe Mchunu talks, many people don’t take him seriously. His “I speak my mind” tendencies have created him a lot of enemies and got him into trouble with the law. But rapper Big Zulu has urged Mzansi to listen to him. He said the former Ukhozi FM DJ sometimes speaks the truth, but he lacks a proper way of doing it. He took to Instagram to urge people to ignore Ngizwe’s rudeness and try to pay attention to him. “Just put his rudeness aside and pay attention to the point he is trying to make. He talks a lot of truth. The problem is that he lacks a proper way of doing that,” said Big Zulu. When contacted, Ngizwe said that he’s misunderstood but he is not rude.

We are living in the society where truth is not told. People lie and lie. “But I’m not rude. If Big Zulu says I lack isisoka (proper way of doing things), I don’t know what he is talking about. I’m a leader, the president of the entire amabhinca. So how can I lack isisoka? Being misunderstood hurts,” said Ngizwe. Ngizwe has stepped on many people’s toes, including former colleague Tshathugodo Ngobe and maskandi stars Khuzani Mpungose and Thokozani Langa. His videos, where he talks about how Mzansi is governed and where he makes fun of celebs, have gained momentum on social media. Ngizwe was also arrested for his slogan, Azikhale, which was taken as instigating the violence that caused the July unrest in 2021.
