A 39-year-old sex worker says what has kept her going are the prayers she recites before she starts her day. The sex worker, who is from Hammanskraal north of Tshwane, said she has been doing sex work for almost 24 years. According to her, this has helped her put food on the table for her family. Unlike other sex workers who use Muthi for protection and to lure more clients, she says, prayer has been her source of strength. She says she works in the Rooiwal area, north of Tshwane. She explained that she was planning to quit her job that she has been doing all these years. “Sometimes, our clients don’t want to pay after we’ve rendered our services, but that is better than been assaulted or killed. That is why I ask for God’s protection all the time,” said the mother of one. She told Daily Sun no one in her family knows about her job.  “Whenever I leave home I tell them I’m going to do some work in the Pretoria CBD.” She prays that someone will rescue her and offer her a decent job. She said she joined a group of sex workers because she was unemployed. Her clients vary between blacks and whites. She charges from R50 to R100 per session. “We risk our lives as some of the clients don’t want to use condoms. For me, no condom no sex,” she said. On a busy day, she gets up to 10 clients and sometimes she returns home empty-handed.
