NOT so long ago, Dr Malinga was swimming in debt with the South African Revenue Service (Sars) threatening to take his assets. With tears in his eyes, he pleaded for assistance and Good Samaritans, including his colleagues, came through for him. Now that he has recovered from his financial crisis, he wants to return the favour. “I’m not a billionaire, but I’m in a position to help five students who need money to study,” he said. “The students must come from disadvantaged backgrounds and must be in need of financial assistance. I will help these students to apply to a technical college and I will pay their fees. “They will enrol for a diploma of their choice at a TVET college. I must emphasise that this bursary is strictly for TVET college students and not university students.” ALSO READ : Dr Musa Mthombeni is smitten with his wife Liesl! But he said he was not able to pay for accommodation and that the bursary was only for one year, for now. “There is a possibility of extending the bursary but this will depend on finances. For now, my intention is to give these kids a head-start,” he said. Dr Malinga said the students must be prepared to live in Joburg or Tshwane. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments “Students across the country are welcome to apply but they must be willing to relocate to Joburg or Tshwane. This is because the college I’m working with is in Tshwane,” he said. Dr Malinga said he knows the importance of education. “This gesture was inspired by my own challenges. When I was going through difficulties, I decided to expose myself and seek help. I know that seeking help is hard and can be embarrassing,” he said. “For this reason, I am extending a helping hand to these kids. I’m reaching out to them so that they can start their journey in life.” For more information, check Dr Malinga’s social media pages.
