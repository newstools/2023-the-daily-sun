Taximen and the Greater Benoni Concerned Residents said they want the drug lords to have a taste of their own medicine before handing them to the police. The fight against drugs by residents has been running for three weeks now and it doesn’t show any signs of slowing down. Residents say they don’t want police to stand in their way as they have failed them. “We know some of the Springs police who are benefiting from these drug lords. That’s why they are not doing anything about it,” said one taximan. The drug search in Springs started after nyaope addicts were accused of stealing from commuters at the taxi rank and the general public in Springs CBD. The group vowed to sniff out all the drug dens in Springs.  “These people are out to destroy our children. We urge communities to stand up. Look at our boy children. If we don’t stand up now, we will have ourselves to blame,” said a concerned resident. Police said there were no arrests after some people were found with drugs. Sergeant Themba Tshabalala of Springs Police Station said no case was opened as the group contaminated the evidence. “We urge people to call the police before they handle the evidence,” said Tshabalala. He added that people who say police are involved in crime are welcomed to bring evidence.
