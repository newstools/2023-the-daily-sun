IN what will be a battle of two former Kaizer Chiefs coaches, Swallows’ Ernst Middendorp will pit his wits against SuperSport United mentor Gavin Hunt when their teams lock horns in a DStv Premiership clash at Dobsonville Stadium on Saturday (5.30pm). Middendorp, who enjoyed more success in Naturena than his adversary Hunt, will hope to get the better of the four time league winner in their latest confrontation. The Dube Birds will have their backs against the wall heading into the crucial encounter having failed to win in their last two matches and currently occupying 14th spot on the Premiership table, with only goal difference keeping them out of the relegation zone. Middendorp admits that there are still a lot of areas of improvement in his team and he has been hard at work trying to ensure that they get better and manage to hang on to their top flight status at the end of the season.“At the moment it’s not about losing or winning at home or anything like that, it is about just making points,” said Middendorp.“Make one point and if that’s what the game gives then take that and you’re okay, there’s nothing wrong with that.“I can’t accept playing nice and having nothing to show for it.“I think defensively we were the second highest in terms of goals conceded until December, we have to be clear on it and work on the defensive side of things. I haven’t been here for long, we have not had the capacity to sign players, so we have to deal with what we have. That’s the challenge for me.”Their opponents, Matsatsantsa a Pitori, are also not enjoying the best of form despite currently sitting third on the Premiership table with 28 points from 17 matches so far this season. Hunt’s charges have lost a bit of momentum in recent weeks, going three matches without a win having lost 2-1 to Golden Arrows, 1-0 to rivals Mamelodi Sundowns and drawing 1-1 with second-placed Richards Bay.
