Abednico, who is originally from Bushbuckridge, was crowned Mister Tourism World South Africa last year. “It has been my dream to be on an international stage and it is a lifetime opportunity for me to showcase our tourism, cultures and diversity internationally. “I also want to encourage every young boy with big dreams not to give up. It is possible to achieve your dreams or goals no matter where you come from,” he said.  Abednico, who holds a National Diploma in Public Administration and N6 in Management Assistant, describes himself as confident, talented and hardworking. “The changes I’m bringing to Mpumalanga and my community at large are giving the boy child a voice to speak and raising awareness to ensure the boy child is not neglected in our communities.” He said he’s not only going to Asia to win the title, but to learn other cultures and create networks that can help with his future projects in South Africa.
