HEALTH Minister Joe Phaahla and his deputy Sibongiseni Dhlomo have updated the nation about the Covid-19 situation. This comes after researchers at Stellenbosch University detected a case of the XBB.1.5 subvariant. The variant, nicknamed kraken, has been described as the most transmissible sub-variant detected so far by World Health Organisation (WHO) Covid-19 technical lead Maria van Kerkhove. During a virtual media briefing on Tuesday, 10 January, Phaahla said kraken was identified in Mzansi last month. He said it was a sub-variant of Omicron, the dominant variant in the world. “Thus far there has been no indication in change in severity of illness,” he said. REGISTER TO COMMENT! Phaala said the ministerial advisory committees and the WHO had been consulted and it was found there was no need to impose restrictions. However, he said it had been advised that testing be increased. He encouraged those experiencing symptoms to approach heath facilities. “The National Institute For Communicable Diseases will also increase wastewater testing, including from aircraft coming from affected countries,” he said. The minister said the vaccination campaign would be revived. He said qualification for boosters would be adjusted to possibly include all adults. Phaahla assured the public that the department has been monitoring the Covid-19 situation.
