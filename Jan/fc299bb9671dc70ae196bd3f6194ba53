HE WAS taken from his home by three men and a woman and bundled into a car. The kidnappers then took Bomba Nesani (31) to Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, where he was questioned and beaten before he was left to die. Luckily, strangers came to his rescue and called an ambulance to take him to hospital. Before he died, Bomba managed to tell a nurse his name and address, which helped to trace his family. His father Dan (58) from Mokgoba near Daveyton said on Monday, 15 January, armed men and a woman stormed into his yard to demand one of his twin sons. “When Bomba got out, they grabbed him and accused him of stealing from them,” he said. He said he begged them to release his son, but the angry men wouldn’t.  “I heard them say he was going to show them where he took their things. “They called his twin brother to open the storeroom to search, but they didn’t find anything,” he said. Dan said they forced his wife to open a big drum in the garage hoping to find something, but they did not. He said his son denied that he stole the plasma TV, takkies, cellphones and other stuff.  “He asked that we give the plasma TV in our house to his kidnappers to release him, but they said they didn’t want it,” said Dan. He said that the angry kidnappers bundled his son into their car and said they were going to Tembisa where they were going to teach him a lesson. And that was the last time the family saw Bomba alive.

Chairman of Mokgoba Men’s Forum, Jerry Sithole, agreed that the kidnappers took the wrong person. “We are praying for justice,” said Sithole.
