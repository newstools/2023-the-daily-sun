 A BIRTHDAY
party in Gqeberha, Eastern Cape, ended 
in bloodshed after eight people were shot dead and three were injured. Unknown
gunmen entered a house where a party was held for the house owner on Sunday, 29
January, and opened fire, killing eight people. This is one
of the several mass killings that have rocked Nelson Mandela Bay in the past
months, claiming more than 20 lives. Nelson
Mandela Bay district commissioner Major General Vuyisile Ncata said: “The owner
of the house was celebrating his birthday when two unknown gunmen entered the
yard in Makanda Street in Kwazakhele and started shooting at the guests.

One of the victims succumbed to the injuries in hospital, bringing the total number of the deceased to eight. The owner of the house was among the deceased. “The circumstances surrounding this attack are unknown at this stage. The provincial Organised Crime Unit took over the investigation of eight cases of murder and three of attempted murder. No arrests have been made at this stage. “We want people to come forward with information that can lead the police to the killers. We will not rest until we find out what happened and who was responsible for these  cold-blooded attacks. Anyone who has any information can contact Captain Sitole on 082 457 2812 or CrimeStop on 086 00 10111,” said Ncata. A neighbour said: “There was a birthday celebration and there were many people. The gunmen gained entry via a neighbouring house to ambush the group. People ran in different directions. They followed those who went inside the house and shot them. It was like a movie, seeing people with machine guns opening fire non-stop.” Police Minister Bheki Cele is expected to visit the crime scene today at 11am.
