JUDGE Piet Koen, who has been presiding over the corruption trial of the former president Jacob Zuma, has recused himself from the case. The judge recused himself from the case on Monday, 30 January in the Pietermaritzburg High Court. Monday’s matter was to get Koen’s decision and also the date for the trial to begin. A new judge, Judge Nkosinathi Chili, was appointed to take over the case that started in June 2005 when Zuma was fired by then president Thabo Mbeki. Judge Koen indicated last year that he may have to recuse himself, given some of the strong views he expressed, when dismissing the former president’s application for Billy Downer to be removed from the prosecution. The former president was not present in court, and none of his family members attended the matter. The court room was not full as it usually is when the former president makes an appearance. And also, outside court, none of the Zuma strong supporters were seen. There was no stage as well.  The Jacob Zuma Foundation spokesman, Mzwanele Manyi, released a statement following the announcement by judge Koen to recusing himself, and it said Zuma is on a winning wicked. The foundation said they welcome the sober call by judge Koen to recuse himself. The statement further stated that they hope that the NPA will be guided accordingly and also recuse the criminally accused no 1, Advocate Billy Downer as the prosecutor of president Zuma. Judge Chili postponed the matter for 17 April for the trial to begin.
