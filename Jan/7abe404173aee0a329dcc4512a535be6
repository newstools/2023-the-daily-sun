Public Protector, Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane will be back on the hot seat in
Parliament on Tuesday, 24 January. Section 194
committee which is probing her fitness to hold office is expected to resume its
work after it adjourned in December. Mkhwebane
had lodged a review application in the Western Cape High following the
committee's decision to dismiss her application for the recusal of its Qubudile
Dyantyi. Dyantyi
decided not to recuse himself from the inquiry on the basis that Mkhwebane
failed to prove that he was biased. The
committee is expected to be briefed on correspondence received from her legal
team which will give an indication of whether the next weekâ€™s planned sittings
would continue where she is expected to call further witnesses. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments  She
intended to call Zambian Public Protector Caroline Zulu-Sokoni to testify in
her defence. However,
Zulu-Sokoni could not take the stand before she got permission as she had just
been nominated as a judge in Zambia. The inquiry
into Mkhwebane comes after a panel of experts, led by retired Constitutional
Court Justice Bess Nkabinde, ruled that Parliament should institute an inquiry
into her fitness to hold office. She faces
charges of misconduct and incompetence.
