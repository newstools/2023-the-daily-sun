The N12 road between Wolmaraanstad and Klerksdorp, in North
West, is now open for traffic following its closure due to a cash-in-transit
heist on Thursday morning. Just after 7am, a group of suspects travelling in four
vehicles rammed into a cash van that was en-route to Wolmaranstad from
Klerksdorp causing the cash van to come to a standstill. National police spokewoman Brigadier Athlenda Mathe said the
robbers proceeded to bomb the cash van.  "Police have since launched a manhunt for the suspects
who made off with an undisclosed amount of cash," said Mathe. "The suspects are believed to have fled in the
direction of Wolmaranstad in three vehicles, including a gold-coloured vehicle
and two VW Polos. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments  "The suspects also made off with firearms belonging to
