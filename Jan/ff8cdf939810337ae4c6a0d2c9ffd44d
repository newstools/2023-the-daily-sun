  The suspect is facing charges of kidnapping, extortion, armed robbery, illegal
possession of firearm and ammunitions. Police spokesman, Brigadier Selvy Mohlala, said the suspect was arrested hours
after a 32-year-old victim was kidnapped and a ransom demanded for his release. The victim reportedly visited a friend in Botleng on Thursday, 5 January. “He left just before 10pm. In less than 30 minutes the friend allegedly
received a call from his visitor's phone who could be heard screaming that he
has been abducted. "While still shocked, he heard someone over the phone demanding ransom for
his friend's release,” Mohlala said. Mohlala said after receiving that call, the man then reported the matter to the
police and it is alleged that more of the victim's friends also reported to the
police that they received strange calls with a demand of the ransom for the
victim's release. “A team of investigators comprised of Crime Intelligence and hostage
negotiators was assembled. On Friday, 6 January, the victim arrived at the police station after he was
released at around 3pm. "He was interviewed and it was established that his cellphone was still at
the hands of the suspect. Investigations were intensified and led police to a
location in Botleng where the suspect fitting the description given by the
victim was found,” he added. The suspect had the victim's cellphone and an unlicensed Norinco 9mm pistol
with serial numbers filed off and 22 live rounds of ammunition. Investigation further revealed that the firearm was also reported missing
during a business robbery that took place in Pretoria in 2020. He will appear in Delmas Magistrates Court on Monday, 9 January.
