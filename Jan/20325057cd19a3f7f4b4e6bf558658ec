THULANI Hlongwane wants to quit nyaope. The 24-year-old from Lusaka in Mamelodi East, Tshwane, told Daily Sun he has been using the drug since he was introduced to it by a friend in 2011. Thulani said he wanted to stop using drugs, but didn’t have the money or connections to get a place in a rehabilitation facility. He said he often used nyaope and crystal. Thulani said the little money he managed to get hold of was spent on drugs. ALSO READ:Sangoma helped me quit nyaope! He said it took at least R100 a day to feed his habit. “I don’t steal from people, but I know this thing is destroying my life,” he said. He said it was time for him to change and build a new life. “The addict’s life is very tough. “I want to change and start to be a responsible man,” he said. Thulani said when he got clean, he wanted to look for a job to support himself and his mum. Thulani said he had been collecting rubbish to recycle since he started doing drugs. He said he first started by smoking glue in 2010. His unemployed mum Thokozile (53) said she wanted to see him change. She said: she was unemployed and none of her children had jobs, so she could’t pay for rehabilitation. “This is a curse to me. I was expecting to get good results and for my children to work to support themselves, but that is not happening.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments
