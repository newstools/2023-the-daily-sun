OPPOSITION parties have been hinting they are planning to act against the ANC following the announcement by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) to hike electricity tariffs by more than 18% and 12% in the next two fiscal years, respectively. The DA has announced that it is organising a protest to the party’s headquarters at Luthuli House in Joburg on 25 January against the ANC-engineered electricity crisis. In a statement released on Saturday, 14 January, the party said its protest would target Luthuli House because it was the scene of a crime the ANC continued to perpetrate against people through permanent stage six load shedding and the 18,65% increase. Meanwhile, Eskom chief financial officer Calib Cassim explained that revenue determination for the fiscal years 2023/24 and 2024/25 would “positively contribute from a financial and sustainability point of view. The revenue determination of R319 billion and R352 billion for the financial years 2024/5 will allow a further migration towards price level that reflects the efficiency of producing electricity.” This after the hike left already struggling South Africans shocked on Thursday, 12 January.  “It is at Luthuli House where, over the past three decades, decisions were made to ‘deploy’ the corrupt and incompetent cadres who plundered and destroyed Eskom. “It is at Luthuli House that corrupt tenders were handed out, including for the ill-fated construction of the Medupi and Kusile power stations that have cost our country so dearly,” read the statement. The party said through its corrupt system of cadre deployment, the ANC centralised all power in Luthuli House.
