ORLANDO Pirates coach Jose Riveiro hopes home ground will help get his charges back to winning ways at the expense of Golden Arrows in their DStv Premiership clash at Orlando Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). Pirates are desperate for results, having lost their last three league matches and they will be fighting for maximum points in their first home game in the new year. They’ll face an unpredictable outfit that has been in hot and cold form but won their last league clash, a 2-1 win over SuperSport United while Bucs are still wounded from their 2-1 loss to Cape Town City last Saturday. The Spanish mentor reckons it will be another difficult 90 minutes, but hopes the outcome of the last meeting between the two sides when Pirates thumped Arrows 2-0 at Princess Magogo Stadium last October will help his side get an added psychological advantage. Riveiro is aware that results haven’t been forthcoming for his side and expect the tide to turn in front of Bucs’ fans, who will cheer his side to emerge victorious. Said Riveiro: “They (Arrows) are not in bad shape, but we have our recent triumph when we won against them in Durban. “We need to be at our best and try to show them that we want to get back on track considering that this is our first game at home this year.” He added: “We are in a bad run of results and not in terms of our performance. “The only thing you can get from games, it’s wins and losses.” Riveiro is still trying to find a new system that will defuse the danger posed by Arrows’ youngsters. “We are trying to dictate which type of game we are going to play because they (Arrows) have quality and have dangerous young players with speed and skills, they are a very good team in transition.”
