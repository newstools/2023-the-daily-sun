THE Department of Health has appealed to everyone to vaccinate, get boosters, wear masks, keep their distance, avoid overcrowded places and wash their hands. This comes after they were alerted about Covid-19 XBB.1.5 highly transmissible variant. The department said it is in discussions with scientists to gather more information, including its transmissibility and severity. The new variant has been described as the most transmissible sub-variant detected so far in the pandemic by technical lead for the Covid-19 response at the World Health Organisation (WHO), Maria Van Kerkhove. In a tweet, Tulio de Oliveira said the variant was discovered in gene sequencing carried out by researchers at Stellenbosch University on 27 December. .@HealthZA has been alerted about this highly transmissable XBB.1.5 variant and is currently in discussions with the scientists to gather more information including its transmissibility and severity. Thus, an official communication will be made in due course. #COVID19  De Oliveira, who is the head of a gene-sequencing institute at the university, said the XBB.1.5 has quickly become the dominant strain in the US and has been detected in at least 28 other countries, according to the WHO. “It’s yet to be identified in China, which is undergoing a surge in infections after relaxing strict controls that limited the impact of previous waves of Covid-19 in the country. No impact on cases, hospitalisations or deaths have been seen in South Africa, so far,” said De Oliveira. The news of the new variant has caused a mini panic among the public. On twitter @Eve13419533 said: “They are quiet and people from overseas are coming back to SA. They will bring the Covid-19. They must stop them with immediately effect. President Cyril Ramaphosa, please do something. We’ve had enough of lockdown.” @Bandilethola said: “Highly transmissible? The other day you told us there is nothing to worry about and won’t apply strict measures and now this.”
