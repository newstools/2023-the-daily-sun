PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has no plans to fix the energy crisis outside of the national energy plan he unveiled in July. This was revealed to Daily Sun by Ramaphosa’s spokesman Vincent Magwenya on Monday, 16 January. The news comes after the president raised the nation’s hopes when he cancelled his trip to the annual investment conference in Davos, Switzerland, to attend to the worsening energy crisis. Magwenya said the president continued to meet all stakeholders to find answers. So far, he has met the national energy crisis committee and all political parties represented in Parliament. “In recognising the energy crisis and its devastating nature to the economy and households, President Ramaphosa announced the national energy plan in July,” said Magwenya in reply to the SunTeam’s questions.  “The current round of load shedding has been triggered by multiple breakdowns of units across a number of power stations. “Eskom maintenance teams are attending to these breakdowns.” Magwenya said that the committee was making progress in the execution of the energy plan. “The president wants the committee to work a lot faster and collaboratively in order to add more megawatts to the grid,” he said. Ramaphosa has also held several meetings with the Eskom board and management team. He was scheduled to meet union members yesterday.
