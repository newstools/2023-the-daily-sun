THE police are investigating an incident where amaphela drivers stormed into a cop shop and released their colleague, who was in custody. The man was arrested during an operation by traffic cops in Hout Bay, Cape Town, on Monday, 23 January. Cops have opened cases of defeating the ends of justice and escape from lawful custody following the incident. The group fled. Safety and security MMC Jean-Pierre Smith said cops were conducting law enforcement operations after a MyCiti bus was set alight the previous week. “We rolled out extensive operations in response to the arson attack,” he said. Smith said several taxis and amaphela were impounded during the operation, and a driver was arrested. “With several taxis and drivers impounded, a group of amaphela owners gathered at the station. Using the advantage that most SAPS resources were out with us, they forced the release of one of the arrested drivers.” You must be SIGNED IN to comment! He said the Metro cops and taxi enforcement unit secured the area around the station while the police started searching. Captain Frederick van Wyk confirmed the incident, stating: “Hout Bay police are investigating cases of defeating the ends of justice, resisting arrest and escape from custody before detention.”
