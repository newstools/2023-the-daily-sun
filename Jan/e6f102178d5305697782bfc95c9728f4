SHE feels like she is a slave to loan sharks and now wants to break free. The woman said for the past 23 years, she has been unable to enjoy her salary and improve her life. This is because whenever her salary lands in her bank account, a huge portion of it goes straight to mashonisas. She wrote to Digital Bones sangoma Nzama Maluleke to help her get rid of what she believes is a curse. She said she tried lots of tricks to leave mashonisas but nothing has yielded results. “I would like to know whether I’m bewitched or not,” she said. “I have been to different mashonisas in the past 23 years. I get a good salary that can last me for the whole month but I am unable to do anything with it because I must pay mashonisas. Please help. I’m tired of living like this.”  But according to Nzama, the woman is not bewitched. Nzama said the woman needs to learn financial discipline to break free from mashonisas. He said: “The bones have revealed that the woman is not cursed by any form of evil spirit. She just needs to take control and fix her financial issues. She has put herself into so much debt because of a lack of financial planning. She still has luck, but she needs to work hard to realise her potential.” Nzama said some mashonisas were using muthi to make their clients come back for more money. He said: “Some of the mashonisas she stumbled across are using muthi. With the little money she gets, I urge her to get herself cleansed so she never goes back to them. There is still hope for her, if she can take control of her finances.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments
