AN ALLEGED cop killer thought he had found a hiding spot and would never be located, but little did he know that cops were on his tail. Earlier on Tuesday, 17 January, the suspect was caught hiding at a house in Inanda, north of Durban. When the cops knocked at the door and introduced themselves, he immediately opened fire. The police returned fire and a gun battle ensued, which resulted in the suspect sustaining fatal injuries. KZN police spokesman Colonel Robert Netshiunda said a suspect who was being sought for the murder of a police officer was fatally wounded when he attempted to kill more police officers at his hideout spot in Inanda on Tuesday morning.  He said members of the K9 Unit, Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation Anti-Gang Unit and the National Priority Violent Crime were pursuing the suspect who shot and fatally wounded 40-year-old Constable Lindokuhle Goba of the Durban K9 Unit and robbed him of his service pistol on Quarry Road in Mayville on Saturday, 14 January. “Investigations led the police to a hospital, which the two suspects were privately rushed to with gunshot wounds from the shoot-out with the fallen police officer,” he said. Netshiunda said one suspect succumbed to his injuries in hospital and further investigations revealed the other suspect had discharged himself and escaped.
