The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) is warning the public about a fake traffic police officer traineeship programme recruitment. The advert is currently doing rounds on various social media platforms. Simon Zwane, the spokesman for the Road Traffic Management Corporation, said the bogus advert directs prospective applicants to download the traffic traineeship applications form for 2023 using the “RTMC” brand name to legitimize the programme. “The advert claims that posts are open to all nationalities and promises work permits, housing accommodation and medical facilities. “The Corporation distances itself from this fake advertisement. The Corporation would like to place it on record that it is currently not recruiting any traffic officer learners,” Zwane said in a statement. REGISTER TO COMMENT! Zwane said when they have vacant posts, the corporation will advertise its vacancies through various reputable platforms, including its website and social media platforms. “The RTMC traffic officer recruitment is not open to all nationalities. The Corporation trains South Africans between the ages of 18 and 35 and does not organise work permits for trainees who are not South African citizens,” Zwane added. Members of the public are advised to authenticate any job advertisement by logging on to the RTMC website at www.rtmc.co.za. Any advert that is not on the website should be treated with suspicion.
