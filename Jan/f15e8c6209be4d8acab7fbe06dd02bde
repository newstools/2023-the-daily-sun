NTAMBUKULO was walking out of his house on 31 December when he was approached by a red Polo outside his gate. A man in the car asked him for some water, but Ntambukulo Ngobeni refused as he was in a rush. He said the man got angry and insulted him. “I told him his tantrum was actually motivating me not to give him water, but this infuriated the man even more as he stepped out of the car to beat me up.” ALSO READ:Kiss your fellow tsotsi or else The 21-year-old from Shimange Village in Giyani, Limpopo, said the man got out of the car with two empty Hennessy bottles, which he allegedly threw at Ntambukulo. Ntambukulo’s neighbour called his mum to come and see what was going on, but the man didn’t stop beating him even though he was bleeding. He only stopped when residents approached him. “He told us nothing will happen to him even if we go to the police station and he was right because nothing has happened. He hasn’t been arrested.” Ntambukulo’s grandfather drove him to Khensani Hospital where he received medical attention. He reported the matter to cops, but the cops allegedly told him to go home. He returned to the police station on 2 January, where he said he was told this kind of case is difficult because if the man opens a case too, they’ll both get arrested.

However, Limpopo police spokesman Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo, said the police arrested a 26-year-old suspect for assault on Friday, 7 January. He said the man will appear in Giyani Magistrates Court soon.
