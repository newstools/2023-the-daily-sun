LETTIE Chirwa wants Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital to compensate her for an operation that was allegedly botched. The 48-year-old from Soshanguve, Tshwane, told Daily Sun she was operated on in February 2019. She had an operation on 15 February and the stitches were removed on 23 February. She said she suffered from kidney issues. “After they removed the stitches, arriving home I realised that my intestines were coming out. I went back to the hospital (on 23 February) for another operation to fix that,” she said. Lettie said after the second operation, she struggled to walk. She said she was admitted to hospital until September 2019, adding that she had to use a wheelchair until 2021. “I reported to the hospital that I was bleeding and the doctors told me that the operation doesn’t heal quickly. I’m still bleeding even today. My life is pain. I am suffering.” She said that she takes 19 tablets a day and can only eat certain types of food. “My suffering has affected my family. I blame the doctors and the hospital. I want to sue the hospital for negligence. The hospital must compensate me for destroying my life,” she said. Lettie, who now uses crutches, appealed to lawyers to help her fight her case. Gauteng health head of communication, Motalatale Modiba, confirmed that Lettie lodged a complaint with the central office and the complaint was brought to the attention of Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital’s complaints office. “Arrangements were made by our central office with Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital to assess her alleged condition. “Ms Chirwa was given the required medical treatment at Dr George Mukhari Academic Hospital.

Ms Chirwa is within her rights to escalate the matter to oversight bodies, if she’s still unsatisfied,” said Modiba.
