OUPA Mtshweni says a neighbour is making his life hell, leaving him afraid to even go to the outside toilet. The 59-year-old from Mamelodi, Tshwane, said whenever he left his home, the neighbour ran towards him and threatened to moer him. Oupa told Daily Sun the man has been harassing him for over 10 years but the situation worsened in December. The man knocked on the toilet door while he was inside, but he was distracted by Oupa’s dog and he managed to dodge him. Oupa, the founder of Concerned Residents for Service Delivery, said he and his girlfriend Shirley Mdhluli (55) relieved themselves in buckets and were scared to even go to the shops. “I am a prisoner in my own yard. I shake whenever I see him and in December, he told me he would kill me,” he said. Oupa said he was fighting for service delivery, which had won him enemies.  “I’m even planning to abandon my house. We can’t have peace in our own home,” he said. Shirley said they were living in a prison, fearing for their lives. “We cannot go to the toilet or the shops. ” After visiting Oupa, the SunTeam tried to find the man allegedly threatening him with no luck.
