THERE were no New Year’s celebrations for the Sithole family. They had to watch in horror as their 11-roomed house burnt down on 31 December. Muriel Sithole (54) from Lebotlwane in North West said she still didn’t know what caused the fire. She said there was a 22-year-old man in the house who was asleep in the dining room. She said she could smell smoke and when she went to check, there was fire in the house and she ran to call the neighbours. She said the flames was too strong for residents to put out. Muriel said she suspects that vutha was behind the mess although she couldn’t think of any enemies who would do this to them. She said they couldn’t save anything from the flames and it would be difficult to replace everything that was in the house.

Matthews Chabalala from On the Spot Investment said they would try to help because what happened was a disaster. He said they would have to break down the house completely and build another one for the family. Local councillor of Ward 1 in Lebotloane Andrew Zimba said: “We’re happy that the municipality and Moretele Mayor George Manyike visited the family.” Traditional healer Kuppe Banda said the fire may have been caused by a jealous person. “Vutha exists,” Banda said.
