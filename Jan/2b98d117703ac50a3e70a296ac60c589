CAPE Town security guard Athenkosi Komanisi, who works at a mall in Grassy Park, is nursing his wounds after a rude customer attacked him last Wednesday, 11 January. He said the customer also pointed a gun at him. He told Daily Sun he was doing his work of maintaining order at the mall and didn’t know he would end up in hospital. Komanisi said a customer driving a bakkie stopped at a drop-and-go designated area. He approached him and told him he wasn’t allowed to park at the spot.  Komanisi said the man only moved forward a little. “When I insisted that he move away from the place, he threw a walking stick at me through the window and it hit me on the chest. I picked up the walking stick and he jumped out of the car and grabbed it back from my hands,” said the security guard. In a CCTV video seen by the SunTeam, a woman who was travelling with the man jumped out of the car and tried to restrain him. The driver kept advancing towards Athenkosi who then pepper-sprayed him.   After he was pepper-sprayed, the man became more aggressive and hit Athenkosi on the head with his walking stick. “I was injured and had to go to hospital because a person didn’t want to listen to what I was saying,” he said. Komanisi opened an assault case and wants the suspect to answer in court for what he did. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi confirmed the incident.
