EIGHT suspects between the ages of 18 and 58 will on Monday, 16 January, appear in court after they were arrested on Friday, 13 January, by Jouberton police. They were bust in connection with alleged possession of two unlicensed firearms, stolen property, counterfeit goods, dangerous weapons and stock theft. Police received information and followed up on it, leading to a house in extension 14. North West police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani said upon the police’s arrival at the house, they found eight suspects (five women and three men) and searched the house. “Furthermore police found two firearms, live rounds of ammunition, suspected stolen shoes, a plasma TV, laptops, till register, counterfeit money production equipment, old South African money and US dollar notes, which the suspects could not account for. Moreover, police found a slaughtered cow at the back of the house and the suspects could also not account for it,” Funani said. The eight suspects were immediately arrested and one, who is a minor, was released in the care of her older sister. The other seven suspects are expected to appear before the Klerksdorp Magistrates Court on Monday. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments!
