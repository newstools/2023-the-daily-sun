THE Mashele brothers started the year on a good note. Samuel (41) and Lasi (37) will soon be going to rehab to fight their addiction to nyaope. A Good Samaritan reached out after Daily Sun published an article in December about how the brothers from Klipgat, near Mabopane in Tshwane, had sold their late mother’s house for R3 000. Samuel said Lasi started smoking nyaope first. “He started in 2018 and I told him to stop, not knowing I would soon join him.

He said a team of social workers would be providing them with support throughout the process. “We will help them with identifying their triggers before they go to rehab,” he said. Reikhutsitse, who has helped hundreds of nyaope users go to rehab, said: addiction was like a demon. “We are encouraged by how enthusiastic they are about getting clean. No one should write off a living human being.” Reikhutsitse said his organisation would be visiting schools throughout 2023 as many kasi pupils were becoming addicted to tik.
