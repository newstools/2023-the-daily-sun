SCHOOLS reopened on Wednesday, 11 January but some parents
were only attending to applications on the day. They were panicking as some pupils were not yet placed, and
teachers were frustrated as parents were following up on applications. According to a teacher at Halfway House Primary School, some
parents did not take their children’s education seriously. “Parents can be ignorant sometimes and they are made aware
when applications are open. We communicate such information prior to the
opening. The problem is that they tend to relax because they know that we
sometimes take late applications,” said the teacher. “My concern is that we won’t take every child on the late
applications list and if one is not taken, it becomes a sad case because they
either have to let them stay at home for that year or take them to a school
they don’t like,” she added.  Parent Lindile Maseku said she applied on time and was
informed that she was on the waiting list. “I applied accordingly, and I was informed that I am on the
waiting list. I did not receive communication, hence I’m here today.” Meanwhile, parents who were successful in getting their
children placed said they were excited. “I am excited but nervous at the same time. I’m excited
because my child is growing up and she will learn some independence, but I’m
nervous because I worry if she will fit in and be able to interact with other
kids,” said Glenda Mthombeni. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments  Another parent Nancy Williams said she did not want her
child to go to any other school. “This is a good school, hence I chose it. Its security and
protection are out of this world. You will not have to worry about your child’s
well-being,” she said.
