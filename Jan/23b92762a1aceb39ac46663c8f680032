 THE police allegedly went into a flat and searched for the drugs in the early hours of this morning, 16 January. But witnesses claim police didn’t find anything. They allege cops assaulted a foreigner and the man later succumbed to his injury. His fellow foreigners took to the streets to vent their anger, accusing police of brutality. Police had to fire rubber bullets to disperse the angry crowd. But the statement from the Office of Premier Panyaza Lesufi tells a different story. The statement said police were following information on the drug dealer alleged to be at Panama court in Joburg CBD. “Members forced the door open and found the suspect known as Omari Athumani Hamisi from Tanzania. “Police searched the flat and found cash, dagga and white substance believed to be drugs,” read the statement. “The suspect became weak and collapsed and died.” “Tanzanian nationals became violent, accusing the police of killing their fellow brother and blocked the road with burning tyres.” Gauteng police said they have damaged a Vispol cars with stones and smashed windows.
