THE body of a 10-year-old boy who drowned on 9 January is believed to be in a crocodile-infested river. Siyamthanda Sibisi from Mandeni, northern KZN, was swimming with friends when he was swept away towards the Tugela River. Reaction Unit South Africa (Rusa) spokesman Prem Balram said residents combed the area along the river’s banks for a week to find the boy. He said two days after Siyamthanda disappeared in the water, two fishermen reported that they had seen his body floating in the river.  “They did not enter the water, fearing for their safety, as that part of the river is known to be infested with crocodiles,” he said. On Monday, 16 January, the boy’s family contacted Rusa for assistance. The crew flew out to the Tugela River on Tuesday morning in an aircraft and conducted a search over several kilometres.
