THE family of the late Dumisani Ngwenya (37) believes he was murdered by wardens at Joburg’s Sun City prison. His aunt, Betty Mashego from Emdeni in Soweto, told Daily Sun that Dumisani died on 9 January after spending a month at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto. On 18 December, Dumisani was supposed to attend court but he didn’t show up and when Betty asked why, she was told that Dumisani was ill. But the aunt started asking questions. “An inmate I can’t name called me to share what was happening,” said Betty. She said according to information, her nephew had a fight with one of the inmates. Dumisani’s brother, Mfanafuthi Mbanjwa (47), said the man he was fighting with went to report him to wardens. He and Betty now believe the wardens came and beat him up.

The cause of death is yet to be determined.”
