THE loving couple cheated death twice in one night – and now they are too scared to sleep at night. They were sleeping when thugs shot five bullets into their three-roomed shack but that was not the end of their ordeal. The thugs set the mkhukhu alight and the couple managed to put out the fire. The shocked couple said they had no enemies who would want to kill them. The woman, known as Sarah (36) and her boyfriend (39) from Maboneng squatter camp near Hammanskraal, Tshwane, told Daily Sun the shocking incident happened on 9 July 2022 at around 1am and still felt as if it happened yesterday. Sarah said the thugs started shooting at a sensor light and after realising they were missing it they broke it down. Asthe thugs took turns shooting through the window.
