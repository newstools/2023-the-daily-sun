FORMER President Jacob Zuma has reiterated his position that he will attend the private prosecution proceedings in person on Thursday, 19 January. In a statement released on Tuesday, 17 January, the Jacob Zuma Foundation said Zuma’s legal team has now completed its analysis of the judgment by the South Gauteng High Court Deputy Judge President Roland Sutherland DJP which granted President Cyril Ramaphosa an interdict to stop Zuma’s private prosecution of him. "The legal team will henceforth and in the next 48 hours be finalising the extensive consultation with Zuma. At this stage, the standing instructions are that Zuma, in his capacity as the private prosecutor, will honour and attend the sitting of the criminal proceedings set down by the registrar on 19 January 2023 at 9.30 am," read the statement. It said the purpose of his attendance was amongst others to explain the latest developments introduced by the judgment, the likely absence of the accused as a result of the said judgment, and more importantly to specifically avoid the adverse consequences of section 11 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977. The Act states: “If the private prosecutor does not appear on the day set down for the appearance of the accused or the trial of the accused, the charge against the accused shall be dismissed unless the court has reason to believe that the private prosecutor was prevented from being present by circumstances beyond his control, in which event the court may adjourn the case to a later date” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments The foundation also confirmed that on 16 January and as ordered by the court, the parties addressed a joint letter to Sutherland with their request for him to convene an urgent case management meeting in respect of the commonly desired expedited hearing of the main Part B application. "A response was duly received this morning and the meeting has been confirmed for 9 am on Wednesday, 18 January that is tomorrow. The Foundation will keep interested parties informed about any other important developments in this matter," concluded the statement.
