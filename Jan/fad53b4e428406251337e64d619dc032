THE 2023 academic year has started and while pupils are returning to school, some problems, including a shortage of infrastructure, are arising. Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha has acknowledged that some schools were buckling under pressure without heavy infrastructure such as classrooms. This was discovered during his visit to the Sekhukhune District at the Tubatse East circuit on Wednesday, 11 January, while monitoring the opening of schools. He said the schools he visited were hardly 10 years old, but their enrolment had risen from about 600 pupils in inception to over 1 500 at the moment. “Despite them being assisted with mobile classrooms, the growth necessitates for further options to be investigated.”  He said as far as infrastructure was concerned, Tubatse was a development node with a huge increase in population. “We will raise the matter with mining companies in the area for assistance so pupils can attend school without any hassles,” he said. Mathabatha further said some challenges included ill-discipline.

Despite the challenges, the premier said he was satisfied with the first day of schooling. “I am pleased that the schools we visited showed activity, and pupils arrived on time while teachers were ready to start working.” Mathabatha said the visits were aimed at monitoring schools with high enrolment and those whose performances required attention. “Our observations are that some schools are functioning well while others require greater support and monitoring.”
