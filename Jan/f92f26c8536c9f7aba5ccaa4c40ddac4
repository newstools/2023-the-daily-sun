COPPER cable theft is adding more woes to the lives of South Africans already struggling with load shedding. Among the properties that are targeted by vandals are community halls, schools, water pump stations and electricity infrastructure. On Friday, 20 January, thugs stole cables from Cecilia Makiwane Hospital in Mdantsane, Eastern Cape, plunging the hospital into darkness. Two suspects were bust by the community and beaten before being handed over to the police.

We hope the police will build a solid case against the suspects. “Vandalising and stealing electrical cable from a hospital is tantamount to premeditated murder because we deal with life and death situations.” Meth said vandalising hospitals exposed them to legal claims as it could affect the outcomes of patients’ conditions. “Electricity was restored to the hospital after the department appointed a contractor to fix the damage. A mobile generator has been deployed to the facility to operate critical areas like the adult and paediatric ICUs and the kitchen,” she said. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said three suspects were arrested on Sunday after they were caught digging up cable in Deal Party. “The Mount Road police were patrolling in Old Grahamstown Road when they noticed the suspects digging copper cable at the railway lines,” she said. “A three-metre copper cable was confiscated and suspects, aged between 31 and 38, were detained on charges under the Criminal Matter Amendment Act. They will appear in the Gqeberha Magistrates Court soon.” You must be SIGNED IN to comment!
