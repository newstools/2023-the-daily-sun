AN ESKOM plant operator is in hot water for allegedly stealing diesel from an Eskom power station in the Atlantis area, Western Cape. According to Hawks spokeswoman Zinzi Hani, the man was bust on 23 December and appeared in court on 28 December. He will appear again in court on 24 February. Angelo Cysman (40), an Eskom employee, allegedly allowed a vehicle to collect diesel from the plant and declared the tanker empty when it didn’t offload the diesel. He allegedly stole diesel worth R500 000. At the time of his arrest, Cysman was at home as he was suspended.
