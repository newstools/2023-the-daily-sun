THUGS in Mamelodi, east of Tshwane, are now targeting pupils. They also rob people on their way to buy food, local shops, and those crossing Mthunzini Park, especially pupils. Resident and community leader Paul Sithole (57) told Daily Sun the thugs rob pupils of their cellphones and rob women of their purses. “Crime in the area is happening during the day and at night. These thugs are carrying dangerous weapons like firearms and knives,” he said. Paul said they don’t have community patrollers. “These thugs come from within SNS and others come from surrounding areas,” he said. He said on Monday, 16 January, the thugs stabbed a pupil and robbed him of a cellphone. He said the child was walking with a friend and when the friend saw the thugs produce knives, he ran for his dear life.
