A FATHER of four woke up after having a very scary vision. He and his wife investigated – and found muthi in their kids’ bedrooms! The 59-year-old man from Mashimong in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said when he woke up on Sunday morning he told his wife about his dream that made him feel there was something wrong in the house. His kids, aged 14 and 16, were both shocked after the discoveries in their bedrooms. They said they didn’t know where the muthi came from. “My kids even cried when they realised they had been sleeping with muthi under their beds,” he said. “When I got to my son’s room, I found a container with an animal tail as well as two bottles, one with red liquid and another with black liquid.” He said his wife also said she had no idea where the muthi came from. The man said that he grew up in a family of izangoma but he never thought he could discover this in his own home one day. He said he suspects the kids were used by some people. “I have a gift and I think my kids were targeted for something bad. And those people want to leave me heartbroken,” he said. He said he hadn’t been feeling well last week but since he found the muthi he was feeling better. “I believe the muthi was making me sick because ever since I have found it, I am healed,” he said The father’s wife (58) said she didn’t know anything about them.

Sangoma Kuppe Banda said that the man was lucky to have found the muthi. “He’s ancestors are still protecting him. I would advise him to consult a sangoma because he has seen the muthi in the bedrooms but he doesn’t know what is outside the house,” said Banda. “You could find there is some muthi around the yard as well. The man must consult.”
