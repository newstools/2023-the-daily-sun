IT appears that load shedding woes have everyone’s lives at a standstill. And one of them is DJ Tira’s wife, Gugu Khathi, who woke up on Wednesday thinking a four-year court case she has been attending would be over – but load shedding happened. Taking to social media, Gugu posted a video talking about the case and how it had to be postponed due to lights being off. “Today was meant to be the last day of court – a four-year long court procession. State vs Cynthia O’Neal, my neighbour, I think you guys remember the story very well. We’ve been at it for some time now. I’m starting the fifth year as it’s January,” she said. Gugu said she wanted the case to be over so she could move on with her life. “The case is postponed and today, we were just supposed to hear judgment. Guys, this load shedding thing... can you meet us halfway? I can’t. I need results; I need this case behind me. I need to clear my name and move on with my life,” she said.
