TRADITIONAL healer Elias Mlambo said his amadlozi have told him to stop using cellphones as they will bring terrible luck to his life. The 58-year-old from Winterveldt, Tshwane, said a voice came to him in November telling him to stop. He said last month, the voice returned and said the same thing. The following morning, his Hisense cellphones broke. One fell into a bucket and the other on the ground, breaking its screen. Elias said he bought another phone but within a week, he stepped on it after it fell out of his pocket. He said his ancestors had been discouraging him from using cellphones, but he ignored them because he wanted to keep in touch with his clients and family. Following the incidents, his ancestors told him they would bring clients to him and he would continue speaking to his family.

I know they will provide me with clients.” He said some of his clients did not believe him and demanded his number. “The message was clear. I don’t want to have a stroke because I have a cellphone,” he said. Client Betty Chauke (39) said people living in the area understood his situation. “I will continue consulting with him if I have problems.” Another client, Benson Nyathi (28), said: “I’ve been a regular since 2022, and his imbiza is powerful.”
