The driver, who he doesn’t know and was wearing soldiers’ uniform, also came out and pointed a firearm at him,” said Dathi. “The other suspect said it was better to shoot him, but Lucky Nelukau said it was better to take him to the Makhado area and shoot him there. Lucky Nelukau started to assault him on the face with a firearm. They took him to Lucky Nelukau’s house where they continued to assault him with a golf stick and wooden stick and tied a rope all over his body. This is when Lucky Nelukau’s brother came out and rescued him. Mudau then managed to run away.” Dathi said the victim was taken to Tshilidzini Hospital with serious injuries on his body and the suspect was arrested. The club released a statement on Sunday, 22 January, suspending Nelukau with immediate effect. “This letter serves a formal confirmation that Mr Nelukau is suspended on precautionary basis as coach of Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila FC pending an investigation into his developing personal matter with the South Africa Police Services.” The case was postponed to Tuesday, 24 January, for a formal bail application.
