THE Cape Town Street Parade was celebrated through song and dance on Monday, 2 January. About 30 troupes from the Cape Flats took part in the annual traditional parade, popularly known as the Tweede Nuwe Jaar Minstrel Parade. The dancers were happy to be back on the streets after a two-year absence caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Thousands of people lined various roads around the Cape Town CBD as they wanted to catch a glimpse of the colourful troupes. City of Cape Town’s acting mayor, Eddie Andrews, said the event was not just for dances, but has an important cultural significance. “It’s not about the music and dance, but the importance of the day where people had one day to celebrate new year, which was slavery. That is no longer the case. Now we own our future,” he said. During the slavery period, slaves were given a day off to celebrate the new year. They were given an opportunity to do so in their own manner.  Since the official abolition of slavery in the Cape in December 1834, Cape Town people continued to celebrate the day. The director of the event, Muneeb Gambeno, said he was happy that they were back on the streets.  “We are happy to have the event back again, especially the troupes and the public who came out to support,” he said. Achmat Williams, the group leader of the Playaz Incl from Mitchells Plain, said: “We are happy to be back after being forced out by the Covid-19 pandemic. “This event is part of our culture. It was hard for us to be off the streets for two years.” He formed the group in 2017 to strengthen culture and to take young people off the streets. The group has more than 1 500 members and it keeps young people away from crime. Gogo Elizabeth Hendricks (71) came all the way from Worcester, outside Cape Town, for the event.
