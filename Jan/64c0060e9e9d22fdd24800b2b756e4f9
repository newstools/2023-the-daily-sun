THAPELO Amad is officially the mayor of Joburg. He was sworn in at a ceremony held on Monday, 30 January. In his maiden speech, the Al Jama-ah leader thanked the city’s residents and councillors for their support and believing in him to hold the office. He promised them to hit the ground running and focus on service delivery to improve city residents’ lives. He said it was clear that they were inheriting a city that was under severe financial constraints. Amad said on top of his list was to ensure that the finances were in order. “In this regard, we will place a greater emphasis on proper functioning of our financial systems to ensure that the city collects all that its due to it and meets all its obligations. We will embark on a revenue drive across all our region and also develop strategies to assist our entities that are distressed and burden by huge overdraft,” he said. The Al Jama-ah leader said they will revisit and ensure the approval of R2 billion loan from the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA).

The new mayor said they’ll be looking beyond Eskom for electricity and find other sources of energy, including renewals to tackle load shedding. “We are going to fix aging infrastructure, especially our roads which are fast becoming dangerous due to potholes. We will fix stormwater drainage system which lead to flooding. We will clean our city and ensure that refuse removal always take place according to schedule,” said Amad. He said that his council will ensure grass is cut to prevent it from becoming a hiding place for criminals and that street lights are fixed. Al Jama-ah holds three of the 270 seats in the council. Amad was elected as mayor on Friday, replacing DA’s Mpho Phalatse, who was ousted in a vote of no-confidence on Thursday.
