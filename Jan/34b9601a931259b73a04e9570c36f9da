TOP maskandi musicians are taking their peace and unity to a higher level by getting to know one another’s roots. They will gather and visit each other at their rural homes to avoid asking for directions when any of them dies. Njoko was the first one to be visited on Friday in Nkandla, KZN, where he slaughtered a cow. Stars such as Ntencane, Khuzani Mpungose, Jaiva Zimnike, Inkosi Yamagcokama, Ngelo V, Ibhova Elincane, sound engineer Thuthani Ndlovu, gospel star Jumbo and poet Kwazi Nsele were also there. He said it was difficult to ask for directions when there was a funeral or problem.
