“WE WARNED him against accepting a position as a councillor.” These were the words of a family member of Sbonelo Ntshangase (36), an ANC councillor in Mkhondo, Mpumalanga, who was gunned down on Friday, 13 January. He was in a yard in Longhomes township when three men entered and fired shots, killing him and two others, Sizwe Mbingo and Sandile Khumalo. The family member told Daily Sun Sbonelo’s life had been a living hell since he became a councillor in 2021. The relative said Sbonelo knew his life was at risk but he didn’t leave the ANC because he was a born leader. “We tried to convince him not to accept his appointment as ward councillor but he told us it was irreversible. “When he signed his appointment letter, he said it was his death warrant,” she said. She said the rest of the family was living in fear, not knowing what would happen to them. Two suspects were arrested in connection with the murder. They are facing charges of fraud, possession of an unlicensed firearm and contravention of the Private Security Industry Regulation Act. They are expected to appear in the Mkhondo Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 24 January, for a formal bail application. Another family member welcomed the arrest and said the family believed the police would do what needed to be done to bring closure. ANC secretary-general Fikile Mbalula and Police Minister Fikile Mbalula were expected to visit the victims’ families and the community on the afternoon of Wednesday, 18 January.
