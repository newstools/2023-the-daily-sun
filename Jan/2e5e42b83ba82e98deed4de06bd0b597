ANC MP Sibusiso Kula briefly appeared in the Orkney Magistrates Court in North West on Monday, 23 January. The 34-year-old was arrested in Kanana kasi on Friday, 20 January, in connection with the death of his wife, Jennifer Kula (31). The state prosecutor, Harriet Seiphehlo, opposed bail, saying it must be postponed by seven days as the state did not have enough information from the investigating officer. But Kula’s lawyer, Gcina Dlanjwa, said there’s no need as the incident happened two months ago and cops attended the scene and investigated.

Suddenly he got arrested in the early hours of Friday morning as the suspect in this matter,” said Dlanjwa. Magistrate Liesel Esterhuizen postponed the matter to Friday, 27 January, for a formal bail application. Jennifer’s sister, Mampontsheng Mohlomi, said they were not shocked when Kula was arrested. “But it increased our pain. Even his behaviour in court continues to sadden us,” said Mampontsheng. Minister of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Maite Nkoane-Mashabane, said what is happening now is a pandemic. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! “Women in South Africa also have their rights, but they are murdered by strangers and also by people who are close to them. We really need to work together on this gender-based violence. “Children also need not be vulnerable and we shouldn’t be in court because of these. South Africa and society has fought and won against theapartheid regime, now it’s in our hands to work together,” she said. Provincial African National Congress Women’s League’s Bitsa Lenkopane said they were worried after Jennifer was killed and later realised that the suspect is an immediate person. “When the ANC takes you to Parliament, it shapes your character. The moment you get arrested and become a suspect, you are no more a comrade,” said Lenkopane.
