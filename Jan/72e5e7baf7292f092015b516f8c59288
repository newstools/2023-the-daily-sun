ACTIONSA leader Herman Mashaba has instructed his legal team to write to Minister of Water and Sanitation Senzo Mchunu to complete the Giyani Bulk Water Project in Limpopo, where more than R4 billion was spent yet taps continue to run dry. He said during President Cyril Ramapahosa’s December visit to the project, he admitted that R3 billion of the R4 billion has disappeared, leaving residents in 55 villages to continue to struggle without water. Mashaba visited the Giyani project on Monday, 23 January alongside ActionSA Limpopo chairman Sello Lediga the party’s head of governance in Limpopo Snowy Kennedy. Mashaba said if the minister fails to respond to the letter and complete the long-awaited project, ActionSA will approach the courts to ensure the project is completed. He said they were optimistic that should it get to this point, the courts will be on their side and that of the people of Giyani. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! Mashaba said during their visit, they found little to no sign that the project was being completed, which was launched in 2014. “Minister Mchunu told the public that the project would be completed in August 2022, then September 2022 and now the date has been moved to March 2023. It is simply unacceptable for the minister to tell the people of Giyani every month that they have longer to wait,” said Mashaba.
