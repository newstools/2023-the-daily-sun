THE death of her mother because of gender-based violence (GBV) was so painful that Thato decided to write a book. “I wanted to share my painful story and help other survivors,” said Thato Mokgosi (29) from Cape Town. The book, titled Behind My Shadow, was published last month although she had written it in 2014. “Through the book, I’m warning other women that staying in an abusive relationship won’t change the perpetrators or make them better,” she said. “You hurt yourself more by staying and he will end up killing you.” She said it’s not only the victims who suffer but the children too. REGISTER TO COMMENT “They’ll grow up thinking abuse is part of a relationship,” she said. “The people left behind are the ones who need to pick up the pieces.” She said the people and the kids left behind are affected mentally, emotionally and physically. “I wish the victims can read my book and see themselves in me and my mum,” she said. At first the book was meant for survivors but she realised perpetrators who read it will see how much they affect people’s lives. “Hopefully it will touch some of them and they will change for the better. We need every platform available to address GBV,” she said. “I also want the survivors to know that they are not to be blamed for the actions of the perpetrators.”
