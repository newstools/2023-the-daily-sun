THE Mpumalanga police have arrested two suspects in connection with the murder of an ANC councillor, Sbonelo Ntshangase, and two other people. Ntshangase, Sizwe Mbingo and Sandile Khumalo were gunned down in a yard in Longhomes township in Mkhondo on Friday, 13 January. Ntshangase and Khumalo were being dropped off by Mbingo when three armed men appeared in the yard. The suspects reportedly fired multiple shots at the councillor, who was in the yard, and fatally shot Mbingo, who was still inside his bakkie. Ntshangase’s murder comes after he signed a motion of no confidence during a council meeting in the Mkhondo Municipality on 11 January against the current mayor, speaker and chief whip. Police have since arrested former Mkhondo mayor Vusi Motha (41) and Wellington Security owner, Wellington Sangweni (52). ALSO READ:Slain ANC councillor believed he was on hit list!

However, the duo has not been linked to the murders and the weapons have been taken for ballistic testing. Police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said two suspects, Nhlakanipho (30) and Bongani Dlamini (38), were both arrested in Mkhondo. They allegedly confessed to the killing. Mohlala said more arrests are imminent. The suspects appeared in the Piet Retief Magistrates Court on Monday, 23 January and their case was postponed to 30 January for a formal bail application.
