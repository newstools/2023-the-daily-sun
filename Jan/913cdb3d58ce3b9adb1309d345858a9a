FOR over four years, the holding cells at Sekgosese cop shop have not been fit for use. This meant people arrested in Senwamokgope, Limpopo, have had to be transported to other police stations, making it difficult for their families to visit. The cells have no toilets or beds and in some sections, no roof. Transport and Community Safety spokesman Ruel Chauke said the cells have been closed since 2018. Residents complained they are now forced to spend large amounts of money when they have to take toiletries to their arrested relatives. A 44-year-old said: “Our family members are detained at other cop shops far away, which hits us deep in our pockets.” A 35-year-old said suspects often went to court without proper clothes because their families could not afford to visit them. Agnes Maifo (51) said: “They are being taken as far as Modjadjiskloof, Kgapane and Giyani. “The situation has also led to residents living in fear as police vans have to be used to ferry prisoners between court and cells. So, there are no patrol cars in the area.”  You must be SIGNED IN to comment! On Wednesday, 25 January, Transport and Community Safety MEC Florence Radzilani visited the station, and said she would start engagements with her counterparts to resolve these issues urgently.
