A PHONE call for help in the middle of the night from a shop owner led to Bheki Masemola being shot dead. The 29-year-old was allegedly shot by a group of spaza shop owners when he was mistaken for a tsotsi who wanted to rob a spaza shop. The incident happened on Tuesday, 17 January. Bheki’s mum Selinah (59) said a shop owner called her son while he was sleeping. Selinah from Tweefontein H near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun she was woken up by a heavy knock on the door. “I went to check and I found that it was a woman from the neighbourhood. She told me that Bheki had been shot. I didn’t believe her because all I knew was that my son was in his room sleeping. I quickly went to check him in his bedroom but didn’t find him. I became scared. I ran to the shop and found my son lying in a pool of blood,” she said. She said they rushed Bheki to hospital, but he died on the way. “I heard him draw his last breath and knew he is gone. I am so heartbroken. I spoke to the shop owner about my son, but he denied calling him. When his sister checked the call log it showed that he was the last person to call him,” she said. Patricia Kokela (32), who lives in the same yard as the shop, said she heard Bheki arrive at the shop. “I heard him call the shop owner to ask if he was okay. The shop owner responded and said yes. In a few moments I heard two gunshots. A bakkie full of shop owners had already arrived by then. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! “Bheki was standing at the door and they shot him thinking he was one of the thugs. The thugs had already gone by then. The shop owner didn’t tell his fellow countryman that Bheki was not a thug,” she said. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said three suspects have been arrested. “One of them was charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm and the other two were charged with contravening the Immigration Act. The gun will be taken for ballistic testing to see if it was used in the shooting,” he said.
