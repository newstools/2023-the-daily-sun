THERE’S no end in sight to the gang violence raging in Gqeberha’s northern areas. Over the weekend, at least five people were killed and seven were injured as gangs fought each other in the area. For years gang killings have occurred across Nelson Mandela Bay and innocent people have been caught in the crossfire. As a result of the murders, Mayor Retief Odendaal has called for the implementation of a 72-hour activation plan to find the killers. Colonel Priscilla Naidu said: “Police are investigating cases of murder and attempted murder following a number of gang-related incidents at the weekend. The investigation has since been taken over by the provincial organised crime investigative unit. It is not clear yet if the incidents are linked but all that will be revealed in the investigation. At this stage, the motive for the murders is under investigation. Police are on the hunt for the suspects.” Christian Martin, a Khoisan activist, said: “This weekend can be compared to a war zone. The gangsters are killing each other and endangering innocent people’s lives. Is there a plan to combat gangsterism that is integrated?” Odendaal said: “The municipality will make all resources available to assist the police in restoring law and order after a deadly weekend of gang violence in the northern areas of the metro. I have spoken to the police district commissioner for Nelson Mandela Bay, Major General Vuyisile Ncata, and called for a 72-hour activation plan. Ncata has assured me that the police are prioritising the violence in the northern areas and he will provide feedback on the activation plan. MMC for Safety and Security Lawrence Troon and I have offered the city’s support to bring those responsible criminals to book. Troon and his team will monitor the situation closely to ensure collaboration between the different spheres of government – and that law and order is returned to these communities,” said Ondendaal.
