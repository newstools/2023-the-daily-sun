MORE than 2 000 pupils in Mpumalanga are waiting to be placed in schools. This was confirmed by Department of Education spokesman Jasper Zwane. He said about one million pupils have been duly admitted to schools within the province. “The process started in May. The admission of the majority of pupils has progressed very well. There are pupils who are still to be admitted mainly in the fast growing towns within the province. To date, the department is consolidating admission in fast growing towns such as Mbombela, Emalahleni, Mashishing, Ermelo and Secunda,” he said. Zwane said other cases that are being attended to are instances caused by the relocation of families. “All pupils of school-going age will be accommodated in public schools within the province. Schools have been directed to conclude the admission of pupils within the next 10 days. The department is also providing 152 mobile classes that are already being delivered to schools to provide extra space,” he said.  He said the department has already set in motion processes to ensure the smooth reopening of schools on Wednesday, 11 January. Emalahleni is still making efforts to admit 285 grade 1 pupils and 308 grade 8 pupils, while Mbombela has 98 grade 1 pupils and 328 grade 8 pupils that need to be admitted. Steve Tshwete has 50 grade 1 pupils and 14 grade 8 pupils, while Victor Khanye has 52 grade 1 pupils and 28 grade 8 pupils who need to be placed. Secunda has 50 grade 1 pupils and about 850 grade 8 pupils, while Ermelo has 357 grade 1 and 130 grade 8 pupils. Zwane asked parents to register their children in schools closer to their places of residence.

It will also be easy for parents to attend school activities and meetings,” he said.
