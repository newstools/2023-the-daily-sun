BRIGADIER Lindiwe Dyantyi has set her sights on reducing carjackings. The new station commander joined the Philippi Police Station two months ago., replacing the former station commander General Vuyisile Ncata who was moved to Eastern Cape in July 2022. “Brown’s Farm is a priority,” she said. “Not that other areas around Nyanga are not important, but this area needs special attention. “We are having carjackings, business robberies and murders.” The top cop said she is working to get to know the community and hopes they can work together. “There is a need for community mobilization. Cops alone will not succeed. Cops and residents must work together when fighting crime.” Nyanga CPF secretary Dumisani Qwebe said they will support the new station commander just like they did with Ncata. You must be

Qwebe agreed with the top cop that Brown’s Farm is a serious problem. He said e-hailing drivers are robbed daily. Philippi Brown’s Farm residents selling veggies near Philippi library said they see people being hijacked all the time. “There are boys who pre tend to be buyers and convince people to sell their belongings online,” said one resident.  “When they deliver, they rob them at gunpoint. I have lost count of how many incidents I have witnessed. It’s sad that people get robbed using the same strategy every time.” Nyanga was previously regarded as the murder capital of Mzansi, a title the cop shop is fighting to get rid of. For the past three years, the cop shop has managed to win back some ground as its name was dropped from that terrible title.
