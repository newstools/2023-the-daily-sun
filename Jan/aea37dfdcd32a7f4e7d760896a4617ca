TWO men appeared in the Standerton Magistrates Court today, 9 January, on charges of dealing in drugs and possession of a stolen vehicle. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the men, Nigerians aged 40 and 43, were arrested during an operation by Standerton Crime Intelligence Unit and the Ermelo K9 Unit. He said the units worked around the clock to check up on information linking the pair to major drug suppliers in Standerton and Volksrust. “Police nabbed a 40-year-old undocumented Nigerian man driving a Nissan NP 200 with large quantities of narcotics in Standerton on Thursday, 5 January,” he said. Mohlala said the suspect was found in possession of various types of drugs, including Mandrax, tik, cat and nyaope. Mohlala said the Meyerville residence of the suspect, who is known to work as a motor mechanic, was searched and a blue Toyota Etios stolen in Wierdabrug in 2020 was recovered.
