KIDS at Kuzimisela Primary School were recently showered with prizes. The Fatti’s & Moni’s team visited the school in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni, to upgrade its library after the school won the company’s Collect-A-Pack competition. The school was one of 130 that took part in the initiative and beat 69 other schools in Gauteng by collecting the most empty pasta packets. The initiative saw pupils from both primary and secondary schools collecting as many packets as they could to win prizes. Previously, schools that took part in the competition were rewarded with cash prizes but this year, the company introduced library upgrades.  Brand manager Phumele Bohlela said: “We would like to congratulate the school on being the top performer in Gauteng. We are proud of you.” As part of the event to celebrate the school’s victory, media personalities Lasizwe and Thembi Seete graced the event with their presence.
