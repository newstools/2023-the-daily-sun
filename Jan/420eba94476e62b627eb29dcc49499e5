THE South African Weather Service has warned that severe rainfall will soon hit Mpumalanga, KZN, Gauteng and Limpopo. Government Communications and Information System acting director-general Michael Currin said as during previous periods of heavy rainfall, there might be flooding in certain areas. “Difficult driving conditions can be expected on dirt roads and extreme caution is advised. In such driving conditions, visibility is often poor and roads slippery,” he said. Currin said the provincial disaster management centres held a joint operation to assess how to address the needs of women, children, the elderly and people living with disabilities during disaster management processes. “Citizens are urged to stay indoors in cases of heavy rain and stormy weather. Parents and guardians are urged to be extra vigilant and ensure the safety and security of their children,” he said. “Never try to walk, swim or drive through fast-moving flood water and please be vigilant for washed-out roads, earth slides and downed trees of power lines.” Currin urged motorists to postponed travel to affected areas.
