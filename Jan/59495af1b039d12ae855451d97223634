NEW YEAR’s celebrations have been ruined by drownings at beaches around the country. The National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) in Port Alfred said three girls, aged between 10 and 14, drowned at Kariega Beach, Kenton-On-Sea, on Sunday, 1 January. A nine-year-old boy also went missing in the water at the same beach on New Year’s Day. A child also drowned at the Great Brak River Mouth in Mossel Bay. On New Year’s Day at 7.13pm, NSRI Plettenberg Bay crew recovered a man from the water at Piesang River. Paramedics tried to resuscitate him, but their efforts were in vain. “After all efforts to resuscitate the man were exhausted, he was declared dead,” said NSRI spokesman Craig Lambinon. In another incident, City of Cape Town lifeguards treated a 16-year-old girl after she nearly drowned at Maiden’s Cove in Camps Bay on 1 January at 3.24pm. Another girl, aged 12, was saved from drowning by a bystander at Cape Sands in Gordon’s Bay. She received medical treatment at Strand Lifesaving Club before being released. NSRI Gordon’s Bay patrollers rescued two people caught in a rip current at Strand Beach. They also rescued a 15-year-old boy in the same area who was caught in a rip current. “He was recovered unresponsive from the water and brought to the Strand Lifesaving Club before being transported to hospital in a serious condition,” said Lambinon. He added that on New Year’s Day at 4.31pm, the NSRI Strandfontein crew went to the Monwabisi Tidal Pool where City of Cape Town lifeguards recovered a four-year-old boy who was treated for non-fatal drowning symptoms before being transported to hospital by ambulance.
