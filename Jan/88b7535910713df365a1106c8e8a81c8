The Premier Soccer League (PSL) is mourning the sad passing of Peter ‘Squire’ Mancer. Mancer spent many years as a PSL Marketing and Broadcasting specialist advisor. "We express our sincere condolences to the Mancer family. Your loss is indeed our loss. Together with you, we will miss the gentle giant - Mancer the dancer. When I think about Squire, I think of pedigree, he was one of a kind. Dependable, tenacious, abundance of energy. His word was bankable,” said PSL Chairman, Dr Irvin Khoza. The Mancer family will announce funeral arrangements in due course.
