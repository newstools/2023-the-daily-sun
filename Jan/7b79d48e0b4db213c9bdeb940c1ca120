THE ANC Youth League has criticised the DA for attempting to march to Luthuli House in Joburg. Youth League members waited for DA marchers to deliver their memorandum of demands, which included an end to load shedding, to the ANC’s headquarters yesterday, 25 January. They were armed with sjamboks and sang struggle songs. They said they wanted to protect their headquarters and teach the DA a lesson but to their dismay, national DA leader John Steenhuisen and Gauteng leader Solly Msimanga stopped a street away and were protected by a barricade and police officers. Addressing supporters, Steenhuisen said the reason they went to Luthuli House was that tenders were given there. He said it was where the root cause of load shedding lay. Steenhuisen said this after some criticised the party for marching to the ANC offices and not Eskom’s headquarters or the Union Buildings.  “We don’t have an Eskom problem, we don’t have a Nersa (National Energy Regulator of South Africa) problem but we have an ANC problem. That is why we are here. “The ANC offices behind us are the ground zero of the crises in South Africa, that is the ground zero of the corruption in South Africa. It is in the criminal house where tenders were dished out for the Medupi and Kusile power stations,” he said.

He said if the party had problems, they needed to be directed to Eskom and said marching to the ANC offices was provocative. “How do you march to a political party to take a memorandum on electricity problems? There is no Kusile Power Station here. They are provocative, opportunistic and effectively grandstanding. They must stop doing that,” he said.
