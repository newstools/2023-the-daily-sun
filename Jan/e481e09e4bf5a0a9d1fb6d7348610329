THOUSANDS of Narazeth Baptist Church Ebuhleni faction members have started their annual three-day pilgrimage to Ekhenana, the holy mountain in Ndwedwe, north of Durban. The members, known as the Shembe, left the church quarters in Inanda in the early hours of yesterday morning, following church leader Inkosi Mduduzi “Nyazilwezulu” Shembe. The church undertakes this holy walk which is close to 100km every year to pray for a good and blessed year. Congregant Nombuso Zikhali (42) said she came from Jozini to pray for a good year and good health. “My family didn’t have a good year in 2022. We lost family members and some even lost their jobs. We are here to pray for a better year and for family members to find new and better jobs,” said Nombuso.  Congregant Andile Ncanana (25) from Mtubatuba said: “This is my first time taking part in the walk and I’m enjoying it. I hope I will receive blessings after the journey.” Register and SIGN IN to read comments Ethekwini acting mayor Nkosenhle Madlala said their partnership with the church goes back many years. “Over the years, we’ve done our part to ensure that previous pilgrimages are successful, safe and incident-free,” he said.
