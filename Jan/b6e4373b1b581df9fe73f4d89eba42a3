IT has taken the intervention of the leader of ActionSA to get a cruel and determined alleged house hijacker arrested. The man who allegedly hijacked the house in Primrose, Germiston, three years ago has been collecting the rental and spending it on himself. The owner, who stays overseas, appointed another tenant to take care of the property and the hijacker made her life a living hell. He allegedly broke into her room and threw her things out. He cut the water and electricity to get her to leave. But the woman tenant stood her ground after the owner told her to stay. The tenant claimed to have reported him several times to local police, with no help. “When cops came, they would joke and hug each other, and I would end up looking stupid,” she said.  On Wednesday, 11 January, Herman Mashaba and caucus leader Hlogi Moseki confronted cops at Primrose Police Station and the suspect was arrested. They opened a counter-charge of malicious damage to property against the woman, and she was also arrested. But charges against her were withdrawn for lack of evidence by the Germiston Magistrates Court, and the hijacker remains behind bars. Fifi Gcisa, spokeswoman of ActionSA in Ekurhuleni, said they were hoping for the law to take its course. Angry house owner Yusuf Anthony said the man hijacked his house.

I don’t know where he gets permission to harass the tenant.” Sergeant Styles Maome said he was aware of the case and it was sent to the province to Colonel Dimakatso Sello, who had not yet responded at the time of going to press.
