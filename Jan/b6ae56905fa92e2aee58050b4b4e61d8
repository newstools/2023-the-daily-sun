THUGS have stolen taps from madala’s yard at least four times. And he’s tired of it, so he came up with a plan to get rid of the thugs and has not had problems since. The 80-year-old madala from Ga-Rankuwa, Tshwane, said he found an animal horn and put it on his tap, ending his nightmare. “I’ve been having problems with these nyaope thugs who steal my taps. They have stolen four taps so far,” he said. ALSO READ:Pastor forced to eat DRUGS! He said he has been buying and replacing the taps and is tired. “I saw that these people are now gaining from me, so I had to come up with a plan to make them stop.” He said when he saw the horn he knew it would be associated with traditional things. “Many people are scared of izangoma and muthi and this was the perfect thing to do. I don’t have problems now because they’re afraid they will get cursed should they touch my tap,” he said. The madala said he never opened a case with the police. “The police have many problems, reporting a tap would’ve been a waste of time,” he said. He said he couldn’t sleep peacefully before as he sometimes heard them bang things outside. “My safety was at stake too. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! “I was afraid that one day they’d end up coming inside the house to steal taps in the house,” he said. He advised gogos and madalas who live alone to be vigilant. “These young people take advantage of our age and think they can just steal from us. We need to stand up as old people and deal with them,” he said.
