KAGISO Domingos has always thought of himself as a game changer. And he knew from an early age that he was different. The 35-year-old from Ledig Village outside Rustenburg, North West, said growing up, when his peers were outside playing, he was in the house trying to figure out how things work. “I dropped out of college as I found the courses to be too theoretical and I wanted to be more hands-on. I was always a curious child and my passion was electronics,” he said. Kagiso has always been determined to make something unique. So he came up with his eye-catching custom built electric trike. Kagiso’s trike is made from steel and can move at about 75km/h. The motorised trike boasts indicator lights, a hooter and a charging port for his cellphone. “I have also installed a solar charging battery,” said Kagiso. It has the capacity to carry three people, a driver and two passengers, on its trailer. The trike can be used in various ways such as for weddings, birthdays, matric dances and in the tourism sector. He aims to attract travellers, game rangers, resorts, hospitals and other institutions to use the trike for transportation. Kagiso said he looks up to the likes of Elon Musk and Patrice Motsepe, who inspire him to never give up. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments
