GOGO Esther Moleme died a broken woman. This is because her son, Mojalefa (38), has been missing for two years and the family last heard from him in September 2020. Gogo Esther (74) from Swartdam in North West died on 3 January and was buried at Swartdam Cemetery in North West on Saturday, 14 January. According to her son Isaac (59), gogo was worried about Mojalefa until her death. He said she would call out Mojalefa’s name in her sleep. “My brother loved politics and was a member of the ANC. “I warned him about his love of politics and told him to take a back seat as it will end up causing trouble for him,” he said. Isaac suspects gangsters might be involved in his brother’s disappearance.  “My mother died still asking about her son’s whereabouts. My mother died broken hearted not knowing what happened to her son,” he said. Isaac appealed to anyone who knows Mojalefa’s whereabouts to come forward. During gogo Esther’s funeral service, Rapudi Moleme, a family representative, said everyone in this world is here for a short while. “We are here for a good cause. I am thankful for your presence and support,” he said.  Their neighbour, Velaphi Makotoko, said gogo Esther was her best friend. “We loved each other,” she said.
