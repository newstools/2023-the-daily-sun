TWO pupils from Soshanguve Secure Care Centre Special School in Tshwane passed matric with good marks. The school caters for children who are in conflict with the law. According to the principal Elizabeth Mathebane, the two pupils, both aged 19, passed very well. Mathebane said one of the pupils even got a distinction. She said the school started in 2019. “We had challenges because we work with pupils with special needs. “These pupils need support from teachers, parents, the Department of Education and Social Development,” she said. She said they make sure the boys eat, bathe, get medical attention and go to school. “They also get medical attention and are monitored by the Health Department,” she said. She said it was the first time the school offered grade 12. “But the school offers a technical, occupational curriculum which is for mild and moderate type of pupils,” she said. She said they have 59 children who are doing the technical occupational curriculum. You must be SIGNED IN to comment!
