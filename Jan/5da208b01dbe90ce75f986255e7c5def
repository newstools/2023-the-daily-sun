THOUSANDS of candidates who sat for the final matric exams will eventually know their fate on Friday, 20 January. The matric exams started on 31 October and ended on 7 December. Last year, more than 900 000 full-time and part-time candidates sat for the exams, writing 162 question papers in 6 307 centres. Quality assurance body Umalusi gave the green light for the results to be released. This despite cheating scandals and other hiccups that marred the exams.  The wide-scale cheating was noticed in almost all the provinces, with pupils getting answers from their teachers while others were bust with crib notes. About 1 189 grade 12 pupils were allegedly involved in cheating, and 1 127 of these were from schools around Mpumalanga. Pupils allegedly paid teachers up to R1 500 to join WhatsApp groups, where answers were posted while exams were in session.
