ANITHA Luthuli is a tiny little princess with a very big heart. The 10-year-old model from Sherwood, Durban in KZN is passionate about helping the less fortunate and uplifting kasis. Her biggest dream is to hold the Miss South Africa title when she’s older because she believes through that, she’ll be able to reach more communities and make a bigger contribution. The multi-talented model is also a dancer and an aspiring actress. “I joined modelling because it builds confidence and it gets you closer into helping those who are less fortunate. “For me, my joy comes from helping others in life,” said Anitha.

Anitha said what she loves about modelling is that it’s not about beauty and fancy clothes, but people who have big hearts just like her. “For me, modelling is not about being on stage and doing my fancy walk. It’s about reaching out to all kinds of life and changing people’s lives. It teaches discipline and opens your eyes to the real problems faced by different societies,” she said. Besides modelling, Anitha would like to be a dentist and help people with their teeth problems because growing up, she had a lot of problems with her teeth which almost made her give up on modelling. She’s the Miss Superior Queen SA Junior finalist. The final is on Saturday. Anitha has previously won Little Miss Winter SA 2018 and Little Miss Phenomenal KZN Queen 2021.
