TSHWANE housing and human settlements MMC Kgosietsile Kgosiemang and councillors opened a case against land grabbers on Monday, 9 January. The case was opened at Mabopane Police Station after a group of people erected temporary structures in block D. Kgosiemang said: “These criminal elements exacerbate an already desperate situation that translates into unserviced illegal settlements that give birth to challenges relating to lack of roads, storm water drains, electricity and crime.” He said the matter was brought to his attention by ward 20 Councillor Neo Mocumi following the land invasion last month. “I requested her to intervene at ward level as the land belongs to the city. “We are not selling or leasing it. We have future plans for it,” he said. Kgosiemang said anyone trying to steal anything will be criminally charged. Mocumi said the land invaders were hooligans who started stealing the city’s land on 3 December. She said she has tried a number of approaches, including meeting with them.

Mocumi said the land invaders were undermining law-abiding residents. Kgosiemang was accompanied by ActionSA constituency chairman Mpho Chauke and other councillors. Khutso Jacobs, speaking on behalf of the squatters, said they were not stealing land and were making sure proper structures were built. “We are open to engage with anyone who wants to know how our project will work. People appreciate what we do in the area,” he said. Gauteng police spokeswoman Colonel Dimakatso Sello said a case was opened.
