A FAMILY wants justice for a man who was beaten to death, allegedly by patrollers. Andile Ndlovu’s family members said patrollers had no reason to beat someone and if he did something wrong, they should have taken him to the police. The 41-year-old man was allegedly moered in Dube, Soweto on Tuesday, 3 January, and died in hospital the following day. His sister, Nondumiso Ndlovu, said someone had Andile’s Sassa card and had been withdrawing his R350 since October. “He gave this person the card to keep for him because he was going through some things but never instructed him to take money. He didn’t even know how he got the PIN code,” she said. She said the man would give excuses whenever Andile asked for his card.

A friend told the SunTeam that after the stabbing, he heard that patrollers were looking for Andile. He was then allegedly cornered at a tuck shop and taken to a park for a “kangaroo court”. The friend said he called cops, but they didn’t come. He then went to Andile’s home to alert his family. “His sister managed to stop the beating and he was taken to hospital,” he said. Nondumiso said if the police had responded, her brother would still be alive. She said those responsible have not been arrested. Colonel Dimakatso Sello confirmed that a case of murder was opened, and no suspect(s) had yet been arrested. “Should the family have complaints on the case, they can contact the station commander or detectives branch commander.”
