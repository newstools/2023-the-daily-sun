Members of SELA (Siyakhula Entrepreneurial Leadership Agency) in partnership with Senza Kwenzeke are determined to get rid of clutter. Senza Kwenzeke is an organization that aims at creating a conducive environment for their community through the cleaning of dumping sites. It also aims to provide unemployed women, youth and persons with disabilities in Pimville with skills and training in recycling, farming as well as arts and crafts.  According to Senza Kwenzeke Project Manager Skhumbuzo Nkosi, these illegal dumping sites can be used as market spaces. “We have three major sites, one which is next to Pimville Community Clinic, Kliptown area and by the Soweto Country Club” “We have a lot of attraction sites so we can use that space as tourist sites” said Nkosi Skhumbuzo said the first cleaning project was successfully executed “The first project we did was the first week of November 2022” Skhumbuzo said Senza Kwenzeke doesn’t deal with cleaning only, “We also deal with arts/craft along with gardening and farming were we train people to have skills “said Nkosi Skhumbuzo told the Sun Team that they wish more young people would embark on their projects, “We have teams everywhere and there is a total of 90 individuals involved” “The more young people we have, the better” he said.
