THE South African National Defence Force (SANDF) says it’s aware of a video clip that is making the rounds on social media. In the video, two unidentified soldiers can be seen throwing bodies in a pile of burning rubble while SANDF members watch them. In a statement, the SANDF said: “The incident is believed to have taken place last November in Mozambique, where South Africa has committed forces as part of the Southern African Development Community Mission in Mozambique (SAMIM). Once forces are committed, they form part of a combined force and fall under the command and control of SAMIM. South Africa only supports its mission logistically.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments  According to the SANDF, the SAMIM Force Commander is conducting an investigation surrounding the involvement of its members in the despicable act. “The SANDF does not condone the acts committed in the video, and those who are found guilty will be brought to book,” the statement added.
