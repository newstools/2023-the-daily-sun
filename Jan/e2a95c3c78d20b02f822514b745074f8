KIRKWOOD residents are struggling to come to terms with the killing of a local leader. Siya Qekema, the nephew of Azapo president Nelvis Qekama, was killed in the Eastern Cape town on Sunday, 8 January. Siya was known as the voice of voiceless farmworkers in the Sundays River Valley, one of the country’s key citrus production areas. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Majola Nkohli said: “Police are investigating a case of murder after his body was found lying at a neighbour’s house in Moses Mabhida kasi on Sunday night. “He was found with gunshot wounds. Anyone with information should share it via CrimeStop on 08600 10111.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments Nosiphiwo Manona, an activist who worked closely with Siya, said he had big dreams for the people living on farms in the area. “It’s amazing how unsafe our homes are. They are meant to be spaces for comfort and rest from the challenges of life but have become slaughterhouses. “He carried the challenges faced by Kirkwood communities on his broad shoulders. “His house was a welcoming home to many people. He was a real leader and a strong and grounded community member. “He saw far beyond the poverty and underdevelopment of this rich soil,” said Nosiphiwo. In April 2022, Siya was one of the negotiators after several days of protests by farmworkers and residents of Addo and Kirkwood. Farmworkers were demanding wage increases and a cut in the employment of immigrants.
