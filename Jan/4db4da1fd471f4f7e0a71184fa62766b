DEPUTY Health Minister Sibongiseni Dhlomo conducted a site visit to the new state-of-the-art prostate facility being constructed at the Steve Biko Academic Hospital. He was accompanied to the Tshwane hospital yesterday by European Union Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, Stella Kyriakides. The European Commission’s Joint Research Centre collaborated with the hospital, the University of Pretoria and the Nuclear Medicine Research Infrastructure to offer targeted alpha therapy to identify prostate cancer patients in South Africa. Dhlomo thanked the team at the hospital for the research work it had undertaken over the past years in nuclear medicine. “As we aim to create equity in access to care among all our communities, the government has an obligation not only to ensure implementation of preventative strategies where applicable but also to create access to early detection as well as appropriate and timeous treatment of cancers to improve our survival rates,” said Dhlomo. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! Peter Moloko (44), who was at the hospital on the day of the oversight visit, said he believed the new facility was a good move.
