A DESPERATE community is calling on the health department to intervene at their run-down clinic. The people of Thulamahashe and surrounding villages in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, say the health MEC needs to do something about the Thulamahashe Clinic as people’s health is at risk. Residents told Daily Sun the dumpster outside the clinic is filthy, there are plants growing on the roof and sick people apparently stand in queues for days without being attended to. Those lucky enough to have their own transport are forced to drive to the Mapulaneng and Tintswalo hospitals about 30km away. A resident said: “The facility is a health hazard and a death trap. The nurses don’t care. I took my child there with severe injuries after a car accident and they just watched us, doing nothing.” Another resident said the situation was reported to department authorities a long time ago after several pregnant women were allegedly turned away by nurses. “A succession of MECs and councillors have done nothing. They are gambling with our lives because we are meaningless to them,” said the resident. Members of a family from Songeni Village said they were not helped when they took their sick gogo to the clinic.

The SunTeam was greeted by the stench of rubbish dumped at the back of the building. Mpumalanga health spokesman Dumisani Malamule said: “The department is finalising the process to renovate before the end of the financial year. Dumped rubbish and vegetation in the gutters have been removed.”
