THREE thieves broke into business premises in the Epping area in Cape Town last Wednesday morning, 4 January, but they were out of luck. The dumb thieves exposed their faces to the camera and they were caught a few hours after their videos and pictures were circulated on social media. The Democratic Alliance councillor in the Bonteheuwel area, Angus McKenzie, shared the videos and pictures in over 200 WhatsApp groups for his area.
