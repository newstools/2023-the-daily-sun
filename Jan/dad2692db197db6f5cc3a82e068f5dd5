THE police in the Eastern Cape are investigating a case of attempted murder after a missing University of Fort Hare employee was found tied up in his flat. According to Brigadier Tembinkosi Kinana, cops opened the case after the 32-year-old was found tied up in Dikeni (formerly Alice), with his mouth covered with sellotape, on Wednesday, 18 January. His colleagues became worried when he did not report to work and decided to investigate at his flat, where they found him. He was rushed to a hospital as he appeared not to be well. “The circumstances surrounding the incident are under investigation and no arrest has been made,” he said.  The institution has been on the news since the murder of vice-chancellor Prof Sakhela Buhlungu’s protector and driver, Mboneli Vesele. The 51-year-old was ambushed and killed outside Buhlungu’s house after dropping him off on 6 January. Vesele, who was buried in Qonce on 14 January, was killed shortly after the murder of the university’s fleet manager, Petrus Roets. Brigadier Kinana said cops had not linked this incident with the murders, and anyone with information was urged to contact CrimeStop on 08600 10111.
