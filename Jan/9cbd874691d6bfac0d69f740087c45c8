NYANGA residents are in shock after seven people were shot while having fun at a house on Sibini Street on Friday night, 27 January. Witnesses said an armed man arrived at the house in the Cape Town kasi and opened fire, wounding five people and killing two. Luvuyo Mafunguse (29) died on the scene, while Mfundo Singenu (29) died at KTC Hospital. Mfundo’s family said he could have been the victim of a faction fight that started at an initiation school. His sister Zimkhitha Singenu said: “It’s unclear, but we heard there was a fight at the mountain and one boy was beaten and seriously injured. It has been a fight since then and we suspect it could be what led to the shooting,” she said. Zimkhitha said her brother left behind three children, including a 10-month-old baby. Mfundo’s mum Nceba Singenu (55) said she still couldn’t believe he was dead. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi said cops were on patrol in Mau Mau when they encountered a wounded man who told him his friends had been shot. He led them to Luvuyo’s body on 2nd Avenue. “The victim was declared dead on the scene by medical personnel.
