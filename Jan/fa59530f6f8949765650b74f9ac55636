UBER driver Khumbulani Buswana (39) believes he is lucky to be alive after he was attacked on New Year’s Eve. Khumbulani from Du Noon had gone to drop off a customer in Blouwberg area in Cape Town and he wanted to park his car so that he could celebrate the new year at the beach. When he drove into a nearby parking lot, an umlungu allegedly jumped in front of his car and told him he mustn’t park there because his friend was going to park in that spot. When Khumbulani tried to speak to the man, he allegedly banged his bonnet before smashing his windscreen. Khumbulani said he took out his phone to record a video but the man hit the window and kicked his car. ALSO READ:WATCH: Angry mob attacks driver over false kidnapping!
