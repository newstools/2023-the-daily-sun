WITH A GRUNT, Maria sat down on the toilet seat, wanting nothing more than to answer the call of nature. But then there was the crash of thunder, a lightning clap, and a heavy weight landed on the toilet roof . . . AND MARIA FOUND HERSELF ANSWERING THE CALL OF NATURE IN HEAVEN! A big tree had fallen on top of the toilet and Maria Tsotetsi (37) was crushed to death on 29 December. The tree also fell on top of her shack, knocking it sideways. Angry residents of Freedom squatter camp in Villa Liza near Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni said they have been expecting something like that to happen. ‘We have been trying to persuade the municipality to remove the tree, but nothing happens,” said a resident. “Maybe more people should die and that’s when the municipality will do something.” Residents told Daily Sun it’s a nightmare living near the trees.

We have been trying to get help from the municipality but our pleas fall on deaf ears,” said resident Johannes Mlangeni, the brother-in-law of the dead woman. He said it was only by the grace of God that the woman’s two children who were in the shack were not harmed. “We have been devastated by Maria’s unexpected death.” Mlangeni said on the day of Maria’s death, it drizzled and there was thunder and lighting which struck the tree. “The tree was torn in the middle and parts of it fell on the shack and the toilet.” Mastandi Seemole Nkhumane rented the space to Maria to erect her own shack. “I was not at home when the tree fell over,” she said. “I was in Tembisa and I received a call about the tragedy. I’m heartbroken.” An inquest docket was opened at Dawn Park Police Station. Zweli Dlamini, spokesman for City of Ekurhuleni, said the municipality regrets loss of life and will send team to investigate.
