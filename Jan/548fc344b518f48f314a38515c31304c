ACCORDING to City Power, only 4% of residents in Alexandra buy electricity. And the township alone owes the power utility R363 million. On Tuesday, 17 January, City Power switched off the electricity of big and small businesses in the kasi and said it hopes to collect at least R36 million by the end of the week. City Power said the local police station, schools and tertiary institutions in the area are not exempted. “The raid started at Engen garage which is near the big mall in Alex. The Engen was found to be operating on what was believed to be stolen electricity. #CityPowerUpdate #RegionE The theft is way too high, we had to cut it. pic.twitter.com/L1E895fK82 “The filling station was about to be disconnected, but manager John Kalavina was given until tomorrow to produce a proof payment of services,” said City Power spokesman Isaac Mangena.

The money owed could be used to build new infrastructure and fix what is broken.” Mangena said in total, City Power is owed R4 billion by Gauteng residents. Small businesses ranging from tuck shops, salons, and taverns are also going to be disconnected. #CityPowerUpdate City Power will embark on an aggressive 3 day revenue collection operation from today, 17 January until Thursday, 19 January in Region E at Alexandra Service Delivery Centre. pic.twitter.com/wkdIKtXAty Daily Sun spoke to a salon owner who said it would be unfair on her business. “I’m renting this space from the landlord and I pay rent every month, which includes electricity and water. I wouldn’t know if they were paying or not,” she said. “Why can’t City Power come up with a system where business people receive their own small metre boxes so we don’t find ourselves in this situation.” Some homeowners said they cannot pay when the majority of the people are not paying. “There’s a lot of corruption going on. Why should we pay?’ said a homeowner.
