THE mum of a kidnapping victim wants to see those responsible to rot in jail. On Wednesday, 4 January, police in Kagiso, Mogale City, arrested three men in connection with the kidnapping of a 35-year-old man. The victim’s mum, who asked not to be named, said an unknown man arrived at her house on Tuesday, 3 January looking for her son. She said she became scared because the man looked very angry. “He informed me that my son and some of his friends broke into his house and stole a laptop and TV,” she said. The woman said she couldn’t confirm or deny the accusations because she didn’t know anything about the incident, and none of the items were at her house. She said she was told the suspects had been seen forcing her son into their car moments after the man left her house.  The victim, who is nursing wounds at home, was not able to speak to the SunTeam. Soon after the kidnapping, police started searching for the suspects, who were driving a Toyota Venture. Police spokesman Captain Solomon Sibiya said: “By working closely with community structures, our hard work paid off when our officers pounced on one of the suspects. Two more were apprehended in the early hours of Wednesday morning.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments  He said all three suspects were being detained at Kagiso Police Station, and will soon appear in the Kagiso Magistrates Court on a kidnapping charge.
