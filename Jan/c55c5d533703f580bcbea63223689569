An excited Creseldah said: “I was always in and out of the hospital, very sick, but doctors and nurses said they saw nothing wrong with me. “People also hated me and fought with me for no apparent reason. “I want to thank my gobela who accepted me for training after we found out that it was a calling from the ancestors.
