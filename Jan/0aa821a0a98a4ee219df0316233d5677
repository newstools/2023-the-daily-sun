FORMER Bafana Bafana defender Lovers Mohlala blames the Department of Basic Education for lack of interest in sports at township schools. Mohlala stressed that the lack of facilities at schools has resulted in kids opting to become glued to their gadgets instead of persuading a football or netball career. Said Mohlala: “When we got liberated, we didn’t see sport as a necessity. South Africa lost direction. I don’t blame Safa, but the Department of Education. There are a lot of schools in townships without sports facilities. “How do you build a school and not have facilities? The ministers’ kids attend multiracial schools, and they don’t care about those families who voted for them. “What pains me is that their kids who have great facilities play football as a hobby, while our children who have a dream to play in the top flight use gravel grounds.” Mohlala is also concerned that his community of Alexandra is struggling without enough football facilities, while containers have been placed at the Rotary Grounds to temporarily accommodate hostel dwellers. “Politicians have killed football. In Alex, they have put containers at Rotary Grounds instead of giving school kids enough space to enhance their talent. How do you have sports at universities running properly while you can’t have facilities in primary and high schools?” The 46-year-old emphasised that the Department of Basic Education will need to go back to the drawing board and plan properly for football to grow at grassroot level. “We started our careers on gravel grounds during apartheid and we can’t allow our kids to continue playing under the same bad conditions. Politicians’ kids play for fun on a grass which is not fair. In Moretele, North West there are no grounds and nothing is happening there. Rhovan mine is building five stadiums in Bethanie for the community, so the department should follow suit and do the right thing,” he added.
