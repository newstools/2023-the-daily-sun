CRIME is on the rise and kids can be see smoking drugs in street corners, but kasi residents are fighting back. Members of the Vaal Awareness Group in Sebokeng, made up of residents, cops and business people, want to take back their streets. Founding member Joel Phiri said criminals were being warned that they were ready to fight them. He said drugs were flooding townships and freely available to the youth. Another member Taahir Theletsane (48) said the group had established community patrols in some areas, hoping to have patrollers in three months. Taahir said they realised it was vital for communities to be involved in the fight against crime as the justice system was failing to tackle the problem. “Community participation and crime prevention has become a key strategy to improve safety and security. People are ready to fight robbery, theft, hijacking, drug abuse, and gender-based violence,” he said. The founders said residents and businesses were contributing to help, and volunteers were working with Community Policing Forums and cops. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments
