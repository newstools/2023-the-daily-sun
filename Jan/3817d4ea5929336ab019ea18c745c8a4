TWERKING like a master is what Christina Moloto (40) does best – but she’s ready to take her skills to the next level. Christina from Mabopane, Tshwane said she has been twerking for free since the age of 16 and has mastered the dance style. “But now it’s time I start charging for it. People love seeing me perform and always ask for more. Whenever I dance, the place gets lit and people enjoy themselves. I make places come alive,” said Christina. The twerker said her role model is Zodwa Wabantu and she likes her confidence and body. “What inspires me about her is that she doesn’t care what people say,” she said. She told Daily Sun she twerks in clubs events and at parties. Christina feels comfortable when wearing tight outfits as they make her dance well. “When I start twerking in the clubs, I make other dancers look ordinary. That’s how I know my dance is special,” she said. She said she has many friends and sometimes people buy her free booze because of her talent.
