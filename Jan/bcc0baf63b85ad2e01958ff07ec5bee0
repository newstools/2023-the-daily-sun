Mauchline said arrests were made concerning some of the incidents. “We again make this appeal to the public: do not underestimate your ability to thwart crime in our schools,” Mauchline added. Reporting any suspicious activity in the vicinity of our schools to South African Police Services (SAPS) or the Safe Schools hotline (0800 45 46 47) immediately can make all the difference in apprehending the perpetrators and recovering stolen property.
