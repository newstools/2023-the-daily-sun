SHE made the mistake of falling in love with a stranger and paid a hefty price for her mistake. The 59-year-old woman was allegedly scammed of R647 000 of her retirement money by a man known as DJ Salimax. The victim was allegedly conned into believing she was introduced to the ancestors who encouraged her to resign from her government job. She was then apparently told she would become R8 million richer. The woman worked as a clerk at a police station in Welkom, Free State. She met the DJ at a creche in Riebeeckstad in Welkom on 25 May 2021 and he introduced himself as Sthembiso Masango from KZN who worked as a property sales agent. They started a relationship and he took care of all her financial needs. On 7 June 2021, he introduced her to the ancestors who spoke Zulu. “The ancestors encouraged me to resign and put my retirement money in a money box. I heard the ancestors say I’m a lucky person. They were going to bless me with R8 million,” she said. The money was withdrawn from the bank and placed in the money box, but the boyfriend disappeared shortly afterwards. James Majake, Legau la Thabeng Sangomas Association chairman, said people must watch out for fake izangoma. “There is a syndicate of scammers who regard themselves as izangoma and defraud people. A real sangoma doesn’t participate in such activities,” said Majake.
