A MOTHER from Massachusetts, USA, allegedly strangled her two children and attempted to kill her baby. This is before she tried to jump to her death in a tragic botched murder-suicide attempt. According to District Attorney Tim Cruz, 32-year-old Lindsay Clancy was charged on Wednesday, 25 January, with two counts of homicide and three of strangling for the deaths of her five-year-old daughter and three-year-old son.

The New York Post reports that cops responded to the family’s home in Duxbury, 56km southeast of Boston, after her husband called the cops around 6pm on Tuesday to report that she had jumped from a window. “First responders subsequently located three children in the home, under the age of five, unconscious with obvious signs of severe trauma,” the attorney said.
