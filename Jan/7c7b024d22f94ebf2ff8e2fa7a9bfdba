TWO suspects, aged 34 and 43, were arrested at Vaalbank in the Nkangala area on Monday, 2 January in possession of a suspected stolen motor vehicle. Police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the car, a white Toyota double cab bakkie, was reportedly stolen during a house robbery at Marapyane Village in Mmametlhake on 29 December. “According to the report, an investigation team has been assembled to deal with similar crimes including business robberies, armed robberies and hijackings. The team has worked tirelessly to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes are brought to book. The arrest of the two is evident of such progress made thus far,” said Mohlala. He said the team received some valuable information from the intelligence structure of the police in the province regarding the stolen bakkie as well as the whereabouts of the suspects. “Details were then followed up by the team consisting of members from Crime Intelligence at KwaMhlanga, Tracker SA and KwaMhlanga Vispol members. That was when the bakkie was reportedly found and two men were immediately arrested. The suspects could face other charges for similar crimes committed in other areas such as Siyabuswa and the surroundings as investigation continues,” said Mohlala.  The duo is expected to appear in the KwaMhlanga Magistrates Court soon on charges of possession of suspected stolen property. Meanwhile, Mpumalanga police commissioner Lieutenant General Semakaleng Manamela has gladly welcomed the exceptional work done by the team, including the arrest and recovery of the vehicle.
