JUDGE Piet Koen, who has been presiding over the corruption trial of former president Jacob Zuma, has recused himself from the case. The judge recused himself from the case on Monday, 30 January, in the Pietermaritzburg High Court. Monday’s matter was to get Koen’s decision and also the date for the trial to begin. A new judge, Judge Nkosinathi Chili, was appointed to take over the case that started in June 2005 when Zuma was fired by then president Thabo Mbeki. Judge Koen indicated last year that he may have to recuse himself, given some of the strong views he expressed, when dismissing the former president’s application for Billy Downer to be removed from the prosecution.

The court room was not full as it usually is when the former president makes an appearance. And also, outside court, none of Zuma’s strong supporters were seen. Following Judge Koen’s announcement, Jacob Zuma Foundation spokesman Mzwanele Manyi said they welcome his sober call to recuse himself. The statement further said they hoped the National Prosecuting Authority would be guided accordingly and also recuse Advocate Billy Downer as the prosecutor. Judge Chili postponed the matter to 17 April for the trial to begin. You must be SIGNED IN to comment!
