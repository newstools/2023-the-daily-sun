be the serial rapist who has been terrorising the communities of Bolobedu and
Tzaneen. The
alleged serial rapist was arrested at the Tzaneen CBD after police received a
tip-off. “The
police have been probing at least 7 rape cases that were reported between 2015
and 2016 which they noticed had similar modus operandi,” cops spokesman Colonel
Malesela Ledwaba said. Ledwaba
said further investigation revealed that the perpetrator targeted unsuspecting
women on their way to Tzaneen town who either did not know the area very well
or he just offered some assistance and in doing so, he would lure them to
secluded areas.  “The
suspect would then rape and rob the victims of their belongings. One of the
victims was hacked with a panga during the incident. The
suspect also targeted women hitchhiking on the R71 road on the way to
Phalaborwa and Giyani. A concerted effort was put in trying to apprehend the
perpetrator who was unknown until he was ultimately linked through forensic
evidence,” Ledwaba said. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments The
