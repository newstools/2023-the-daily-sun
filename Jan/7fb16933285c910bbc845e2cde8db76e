THE family of Bonile “Nowizana” Ndlabu is devastated after he was found dead in a burning shack on New Year’s Day. The 36-year-old celebrated the new year with his family but decided to go to his house, which is about a kilometre from his family’s house. His sister Zoleka (44) said he left their home around 3am and walked to his house. An hour later, Bonile’s neighbour told them his shack was on fire. After the fire was put out, they found his body inside the shack. Zoleka said they realised Bonile had some wounds on his head and back. The family suspects he was attacked before his house was set alight. “He had what looked like stab wounds. We suspect that burning the house was just a cover-up. Someone attacked him and set his shack alight to make it look like a shack fire,” said Zoleka.

Bonile’s mum Nozolile (78) said she suspects her son arrived at his shack while thugs were inside or he was followed home. She suspects he was attacked in his shack and it was set alight. “I feel he should have just slept at home and gone home in the morning because it looks like death was just waiting for him on his way home,” said Nozolile.  Zoleka said her brother leaves behind two children, aged seven and 11. Police spokesman Sergeant Wesley Twigg said the inquest was being investigated by Philippi East police. “As soon as the autopsy is done and a post mortem report is made available, this office will be in a position to confirm the cause of death,” he said.
