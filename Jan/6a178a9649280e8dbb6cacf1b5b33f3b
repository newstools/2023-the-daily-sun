MANDLA Mbotho needs assistance to follow his dreams. The 25-year-old model from Potchefstroom, North West, has been invited to take part in a pageant in Bangkok, Thailand, but needs money to travel there. Mandla said he received a letter, which Daily Sun has seen, from the Mister Altitude International Pageant in November and he desperately wants to participate in the event, taking place from 22 to 28 May. Registration costs R15 500 while the flight costs R20 000. Mandla is asking SunReaders to help him pay for his flight. He said he wanted to bring honour to Mzansi.
