THE Mamelodi Sundowns freight train rumbles on, flattening any and everything on its path. The rampant Brazilians continued their march towards an unprecedented sixth consecutive DStv Premiership title with yet another comfortable win. They defeated Chippa United 2-1 at Loftus Versfeld last night, thanks to goals from Teboho Mokoena and Peter Shalulile while Thabiso Lebitso bagged a consolation for the visitors. It was Sundowns’ tenth win on the bounce in the league, repeating a feat they last achieved in 2014 under the guidance of Pitso “Jingles” Mosimane. They now have their sights set on smashing the record for the longest winning streak in the history of the PSL, which is 11 matches, and it also happens to belong to Sundowns. The Tshwane giants have amassed 11 wins on the spin back in the 2006/07 campaign to set the record for the longest winning streak of league games in a single season in the PSL era. After their win over the not so hot Chilli Boys, Downs opened a massive 13 point lead at the summit of the Premiership table and look unstoppable. They have now won six matches in a row under the sole guidance of Rhulani Mokwena as head coach, a move that seems to have paid off big time for the club. Mokwena has worked his magic since taking over on his own, with the Brazilians not only winning matches more consistently but doing so with more conviction. They have not only been prolific in front of goal with 16 goals in those six matches, but they have also been rock solid at the back, conceding only one goal. Mokwena will hope that his side don’t rest on their laurels and they continue their winning momentum when they face Tshwane rivals SuperSport United at the same venue on Monday (6pm). Chippa, on the other hand, are now winless in their last five matches and coach Morgan Mammila’s side seems to be slowly running out of luck. They’ll hope to rediscover their mojo when they host Cape Town City at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday (5:30pm).
