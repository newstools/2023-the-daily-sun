BEACHGOERS have been using creative ways to trick cops so that they can smuggle booze into beaches illegally. MMC of Safety and Security, Jean-Pierre Smith, said some beachgoers went to the extent of wrapping booze in baby blankets and pretending to be carrying a baby to the beach. Smith said since the beginning of last month, they confiscated 18 000 litres of booze. “Our alcohol confiscation cases soared and while there’s a drop in the overall litres confiscated, that’s only because people are employing different tactics to get alcohol into our public spaces. “Bottles of spirits have now become sachets, large beers have been replaced by smaller bottles, and tales also abound of people disguising alcohol as babies wrapped in blankets or using their children’s milk and juice bottles to smuggle alcohol onto the beaches,” said Smith.
