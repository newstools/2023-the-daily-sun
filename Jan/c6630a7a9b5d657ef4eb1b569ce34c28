A FIDELITY security guard was gunned down during a cash-in-transit heist on the R40 near Hazyview, Mpumalanga, on Wednesday, 25 January. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the security guard, who was also working as a co-driver, was killed while others sustained minor injuries. “The suspects then fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of cash. A group of about 15 armed suspects, who were driving in a number of vehicles, had attacked the guards travelling towards Hazyview in two vans,” he said. The suspects used the Mercedes-Benz they were driving to collide head-on with the cash van. “They further fired shots at the guards, resulting in one dying after sustaining serious injuries. The suspects then robbed the guards of their firearms, and detonated some explosives. The Mercedes-Benz they were using, and the security van, were destroyed by the fire during the incident,” he added. The suspects took an undisclosed amount of cash.  “They then fled the scene in a Jeep Cherokee, SUV Kia and Ford Ranger double cab bakkie. They took the direction of Masoyi and members of the police, in collaboration with other security forces, joined hands in pursuit. A shoot-out ensued between the suspects and law enforcement agencies,” he said. Later, one of the robbed firearms, a revolver, was recovered at the scene. Mohlala added that the undisclosed amount of cash stolen during the incident was later found in nearby bushes.
