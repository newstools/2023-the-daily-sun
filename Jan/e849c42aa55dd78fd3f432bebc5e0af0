THE nyaope thugs who had broken into a shack to steal a plasma TV, a microwave and Tupperware on Christmas Eve were in high spirits. On Christmas Day, they couldn’t contain their excitement, boasting about how much money they got from selling the goods. But their joy was short-lived. Kids informed the community patrollers about the nyaope boys and they were soon caught. Patrollers forced them to tell them where they had stolen the goods, and who they had sold it to. They led the patrollers to the buyers and the goods were found. The stolen goods belonged to Siphokazi Ganyela (31) from Bekkersdal, west of Joburg. Siphokazi couldn’t believe her eyes when there was a knock at her door and she was greeted by patrollers who brought back her stolen goods.

She thanked the kids who overheard the boys and told the patrollers. “I was going to have a nasty Christmas, so thanks for saving my day,” she said. She got her microwave, plasma TV and Tupperware back. Patroller Sydney Gaaname said it was their priority to fight crime in kasi. “We have had success stories and this is one of them,” he said. Sydney said they were working with the police to fight crime. “We warm residents to stop buying stolen goods as they encourage thugs to steal,” he said. Residents gave the thieves a few lashes and warned them not to steal again. They were not handed to the police.
