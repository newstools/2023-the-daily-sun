LITTLE Bokgabo Poo’s father, Irvin Ndlovu, has asked Wattville residents to celebrate his late daughter’s birthday. Bokgabo would have turned five years old on Thursday, 12 January, but she was sadly killed in October. Ntokozo Zikhale, the man accused of killing Bokgabo, will appear in the Benoni Magistrates Court on 14 February. Irvin spent hours at the cemetery on her special day. “You won’t be able to enjoy your birthday cake, but I’ll share some bedtime stories with you and you’ll tell me what it’s like there in heaven,” said Irvin to his daughter. Remembering the day she was born, Irvin said he was excited when he received the call.  “I ran to my family and broke the exciting news to them. Everybody was excited. We prayed and thanked God. We rejoiced,” said Irvin. He said he couldn’t contain his excitement when he arrived at Tambo Memorial Hospital to meet his daughter. “I arrived full of smiles and euphoria. I held her. I felt proud to be a new father,” said Irvin. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments Wattville residents sent messages of love to the Ndlovu and Poo families.
