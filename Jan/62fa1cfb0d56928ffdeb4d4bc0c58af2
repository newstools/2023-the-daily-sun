RESIDENTS of Raymond Mhlaba Municipality constantly have dry taps, forcing them to share water with animals. Vandalism of water infrastructure continues to cripple the Eastern Cape municipality and the situation has become so bad that Gift of the Givers has dug boreholes. Water and sanitation department spokeswoman Wisane Mavasa said: “We are experiencing vandalism of the local pump station at Fort Beaufort and surrounding areas, which has left the residents without the supply of water. “The department condemns in the strongest terms the vandalism of water infrastructure. This sets the government back and deprives communities of essential services. “There’s no justification whatsoever for vandalising water infrastructure. It’s an act of criminality that undermines the government’s effort to supply water to communities in a sustainable manner.” She said when water infrastructure was damaged, the government had to spend money it had not budgeted for to do repairs. REGISTER TO COMMENT! “The department, working with Amathole District Municipality, is working around the clock to restore uninterrupted water supply to the areas affected by damaged pump stations and has dispatched water trucks. This is an interim measure while efforts to fix the vandalised Bhofolo Pump Station are underway,” she said. Mavasa urged residents to report criminal acts to the police because vandalism affected them directly. “The disruption of water supply because of vandalism has exacerbated the ongoing challenges experienced in the area such as water demand that exceeds water supply, as well as the effects of load shedding,” she said. On Monday 16 January, residents blocked the R76 between Fort Beaufort and Alice with burning tyres, demanding water. The town has not had stable water supply since November 2022.
