 TRULY authentic music is rare and is something to treasure. One such musical treasure is the award-winning Bongeziwe Mabandla. The musician from the Eastern Cape sat down to talk to us about his new single, Noba Bangathini, on this week’s episode of Famous Friday. “I’ve been working on this album since my last album dropped in 2020. “During Covid-19, I worked on new music and now that it’s done, we’re about to drop the new single, which is a love song influenced by a Xhosa R&B sound,” he said. Bongeziwe said he was sharing his vulnerability with his upcoming album. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments “My albums are always lyrical. My music is always about the lyrics. On this album, I vulnerably speak about love and more importantly, self-love,” he said. Bongeziwe said he featured his mum on the album and worked with the same producers he had for his previous albums, including Tiago Correia-Paulo. The album, which is still untitled, is set to be released around April. When asked about songs he would love to cover, he said: “Some of my favourite songs I’d love to sing my own version of are X-Factor by Lauryn Hill and the late Dr Sbongile Khumalo’s Mayihlome.” Listen to
