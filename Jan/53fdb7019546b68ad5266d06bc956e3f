MPUMALANGA South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) wants to remind and assure beneficiaries that the gold payment card is still valid. Agency spokesman Senzeni Ngubeni said: “Beneficiaries must not panic or succumb to the hijacking by scammers and circulating fake news that the card will expire in April 2023. Sassa is conveying a correct message that the payment gold card is still authentic and can be used either in Postbank, ATMs and merchants,” he said. ALSO READ:PICS: Sassa cards fraudsters bust!
