SEDGLO Beauty and Hair Salon made sure the Christmas spirit reached Tswelopele. The salon at the Mall of Tembisa in Ekurhuleni gave food parcels to eight elderly people in the kasi to make sure they had a happy Christmas. Salon owner Ebenezer Essel said they believed in giving back to the community. “We have always wanted to give and now that we have done it, it feels great. “We are with the Mall of Tembisa and giving back to the community is their mandate, so we want to adapt to that and show appreciation to clients who constantly support us,” he said. Ebenezer said the donation was informed by the relationship he had with one of the beneficiaries. He said he asked her to look for seven other elderly people in the kasi who would benefit from the drive. Beneficiary Thobekile Mceleni said: “Thank you for remembering us. May the Lord bless you and your business.” Ebenezer said he was happy with the outcome of the salon’s first community engagement, and that there was more to come.
