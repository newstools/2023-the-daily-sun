Matshele called on women organisations to encourage young women not to kill their babies, and to rather take them to child centres. “We all don’t know what happened. But according to my personal perspective someone killed the baby primarily because she can’t afford it and the father distanced himself. We call on police to leave no stone unturned. This is inhuman behaviour which cannot be tolerated,” said Matshele.
