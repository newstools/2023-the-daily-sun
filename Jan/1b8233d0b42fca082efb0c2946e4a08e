THE Department of Correctional Services recovered several contraband, including 300 cellphones, in a raid at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town. This during a search and seizure operation on Wednesday, 4 January. It was led by Correctional Services commissioner Makgothi Thobakgale, accompanied by the department’s emergency support team and 466 recruits. Among the contraband confiscated were 105 chargers, 89 earphones, 15 power banks, 60 cellphone batteries, an okapi knife and 50 handmade sharp objects. Officers also found a Wi-Fi 4G router, memory sticks, dagga, Mandrax and tic in the cells. “The objective was to clean the facility by removing illegal items defined as contraband, and expose the newly recruits to the real world of corrections as they resume their practical training,” said department spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo.  The search took place a day after a prison official was bust with drugs worth R1,2 million in Vanrhynsdorp. Thobakgale urged the recruits to be disciplined and eager to make a positive contribution to the rehabilitation efforts of the department.
