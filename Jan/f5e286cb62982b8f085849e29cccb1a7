RANGA Chivaviro compounded Stellenbosch FC woes when he scored an equaliser at the stroke of full-time to earn Marumo Gallants a point in a 1-1 draw at Danie Craven Stadium on Wednesday night. It looked like Stellenbosch were finally going to snap their six matches winless run in the DStv Premiership, as they were in the lead for the better half of the match. Junior Mandieta had put Stellies in the driving seat in the 50th minute. However, Chivaviro, who was introduced in the second half, had different plans, scoring his third goal of the season with a fine header converting Katlego Otladisa’s well-timed cross. The draw will now put Stellenbosch coach Steve Barker under immense pressure, leaving them in an unfamiliar position, 13 on the log with 17 points from 16 games. So far this season, Stellenbosch has been a shadow of the team that surpassed expectations last season and went to finish in position four. The Winelands-based outfit seems to be struggling to adjust to changes as they lost key players Ashley du Preez and Zitha Kwinika to Kaizer Chiefs. At the same time, veteran defender Rafiq De Goede left them to join Maritzburg United. On top of that, coach Steve Barker injected his squad with inexperienced young players (Olwethu Makhanya, Mervin Boji, Oshwin Andries and Devin Titus, to mention a few) from the club’s reserve team. On the flip side, things are also not looking great for not-so-gallant Marumo, as they have gone four matches without a win. The draw left Gallants second from the bottom of the table with 14 points from 16 games. They have the same points as Maritzburg United, who are at the foot of the table. Goals separate them.
