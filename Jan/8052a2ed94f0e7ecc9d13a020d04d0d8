THERE were fewer car accidents and deaths on KZN’s roads over the 2022 festive season than in previous years. This is according to Transport and Community Safety and Liaison MEC Sipho Hlomuka, who said he was satisfied with the decrease. Hlomuka said the provincial government was taking stock of enforcement operations over the festive season, and was pleased that early reports suggested a considerable decrease. “The province set a target of a 10% reduction and the indications are that we are currently at a 13% reduction. The situation is currently being monitored as most holidaymakers are on their way home,” the MEC said. Hlomuka said there were high volumes of traffic on the N2 and N3. “There are other provincial roads linking small towns which are heavily monitored by traffic enforcement, comprising of the Road Traffic Inspectorate, the National Traffic Police and local authorities,” he said.

Hlomuka commended law enforcement agencies, saying their visibility and commitment was yielding positive results. “While we are at a preliminary stage of the assessment of our performance, all indications are pointing to a decrease of both crashes and fatalities,” he said. “We are, however, not taking our eyes off the ball as our enforcement teams are still monitoring the movement on the road.” Road user Nkosinathi Ntuli (43) said he was pleased to hear there were fewer fatalities. “I travelled form Durban to Ulundi and what I noticed was that there were no accidents and motorists were driving responsibly,” he said.
