PARENTS at Makoko Primary School in Mpumalanga want the Department of Education to fix the school. This after the roof was blown away by a storm in 2019, leaving the windows and doors also damaged. They claimed that nothing had been done since then, except providing temporary classrooms. School Governing Body chairman Fanani Ngwenyama told Daily Sun they wanted a permanent structure. “We know half a loaf bread is better than none. But since this is an old school, we would be glad if they build a new one or fix the damaged classrooms,” he said. The school currently has over 300 pupils, with only three classrooms in good condition. Ngwenyama said they wanted to do away with mobile classrooms. “We are afraid we might put our children in danger if we use the cracking classes,” he said. Parent Colani Sifunda said the department had not been responding to their call since 2019. REGISTER TO COMMENT! “Nothing has been done except bringing mobile classrooms. We are concerned because the number of pupils increases every year,” he said. Mpumalanga education spokesman Jasper Zwane said the department, in collaboration with the Department of Public Works, Roads and Transport, was accelerating a programme to improve school infrastructure. “Contractors have been appointed and are on site to fix some of the schools damaged by storms. The department has placed orders for 152 mobile classrooms that will be distributed to some schools. They are expected to be delivered by the end of January,” he said. In Gauteng, Education MEC Matome Chiloane said the new application system was working. This despite the high number of frustrated parents seeking placement. Some said they had done all they could but were sad their children would not join others on the first day. However, Chiloane said less than 2 000 kids were unplaced and did not say when they would be. He said the department was ready for the reopening on today, 11 January.
