TSHWANE has a new police commissioner. Major-General Azwinndini Nengovhela was introduced on Wednesday, 4 January at Herlewing Sentrum Church. He will head up 36 police stations in Tshwane. Speaking at the ceremony, Nengovhela said crime is not the problem of the police alone, but of the entire society. “We need evidence and information from the community, but most importantly police must have solutions to deal with the high rate of crime,” he said.
