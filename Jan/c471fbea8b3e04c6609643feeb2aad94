POLICE are investigating a case of a multiple murder after five burnt bodies of men were found in Delft on Monday, 2 January. It’s alleged that the people were killed by a group of community members over the weekend. Police spokesman Andre Traut said the information available suggests that the men were beaten up by community members before they set their bodies alight. Traut said the men allegedly stole a cellphone and the residents took matters into their own hands. “It’s alleged that the victims, aged between 25 and 36, were accused by the community of breaking into a house in the area and stealing a cellphone. They were caught, beaten and set alight. The circumstances surrounding the incident are under investigation and arrests are yet to be made. Vigilantism is condemned in the strongest possible terms and those who take the law into their own hands will be pursued and prosecuted as criminals,” said Traut.  CPF chairman for Delft pastor Charles George confirmed the incident. He said it was unfortunate that people were taking the law into their own hands. “We don’t encourage people to take the law into their hands but at the same time people are fed-up with crime. You work very hard for your money and then someone just walks into your house and robs you,” he said. You must be
SIGNED IN to read comments Pastor George said Delft’s population is growing and resources including cops are not matching the growth. “Cop shops are understaffed. When you report a case sometimes there are no vans or cops available to assist because the numbers are not enough. People are now taking matters into their own hands. They are tired to see that sometimes people get arrested but a few days later you see them on the street continuing with their criminal activities. People are angry and are now resorting to these kind of things to deal with their problems permanently and warning the would-be criminals in the process,” he said. Cops are still investigating the matter.
