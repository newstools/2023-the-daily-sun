THE struggling Ugu District Municipality has suffered a big blow as its municipal manager has died. The municipality, which was on the recovery route, has lost a crucial player. Dr Elliot Ntombela died on Saturday, 14 December, after a short illness. It is said that he was in hospital for three weeks. His untimely death has been a great shock to the municipality as he was expected to be discharged from hospital and resume his official duties in the new year. Ntombela joined the municipality in an acting capacity in July 2021 and was later appointed on a five-year contract as a municipal manager in October last year. Mayor Phumlile Mthiyane said Ntombela played a critical and very important role in the municipality’s administration and they had hoped he’d use his expertise to steer Ugu to greater heights. “We hoped he would be discharged and come back to drive this municipality to a better state,” she said.  Mthiyane said that the municipality would like to ask members of the public to give the family space as they deal with the loss. KZN Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Sihle Zikalala said Ntombela’s untimely death leaves a gaping hole in the sphere of local government in the province. “As a dedicated servant, Ntombela went beyond the call of duty when fulfilling the tasks that were bestowed upon him as a result of his position,” he said. Zikalala said that as they mourn his death, they’re certain that the work he had started in the district will be a solid foundation for the ongoing work of stabilising the municipality.
