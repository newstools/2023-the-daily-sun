IT HAS been four years since former Leeds and Mamelodi Sundowns striker Philemon Masinga died. The late Bafana Bafana star died at Wits Donald Gordon Hospital in Joburg on 13 January 2019. His death did not only affect his family or Mzansi as a whole, but the entire world as he was a soccer icon. Daily Sun exclusively spoke to Masinga’s wife Ntombi and his son, Sifiso. They both remembered his last hour. Ntombi said she managed to spend some time with him and gave him a kiss before nurses asked her to excuse them. She said the last words from Masinga to her were: “I love you too.” Sifiso said there was a noticeable difference in the atmosphere on the morning of his father’s last day. “Ordinarily, we would spend the entire day in the ward, but to my surprise, everyone was at reception instead,” he said. He said he was told that his father was not responding and nurses were examining him.

After Masinga’s death, Ntombi said she felt like the carpet had been removed from underneath her. “I lost my balance and staggered. I continue to do so as I slowly tried to rebuild my life without him,” she said. Ntombi’s wish is that we all remember Masinga for the joy he brought.
