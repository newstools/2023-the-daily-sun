SHE played the role of a pastor’s pregnant fiance in Uzalo. Viewers now believe that she’s pregnant in real life and speculate it’s the reason Uzalo fired her. But actress Nompilo Maphumulo said she’s not expecting. She said her time is up on Uzalo and that’s why she’s being released. “I think the fake tummy that I’m wearing on set looks real and I portray the role of a pregnant woman well. That’s why people think I’m really pregnant. I’m very much not pregnant. There’s no bun in the oven here,” said Nompilo. She said that there’s no actor or actress who works for a production forever.

If I’m not mistaken, we are less than five actors who started when Uzalo debuted on TV screens in 2015. So, everyone has their time. I had my time and it was a wonderful experience. I worked with a wonderful crew and learnt a lot about acting. I have my achievements due to acting on Uzalo. Now it’s my time to bow out,” said Nompilo. The 40-year-old from KwaMashu, north of Durban, said she’s been asked on social media if Uzalo fired her due to pregnancy. “I just laugh off the question. But I’m glad that people are asking. I hate speculations and lies,” said Nompilo.
