FORMER Kaizer Chiefs players Dumisani Zuma, Ramahlwe Mphahlele and George Maluleka came back to haunt their former side when AmaZulu thrashed Amakhosi 4-0 in the DStv Premiership match at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday night. Chiefs defence failed to defend set-pieces as Zuma and Mphahlele scored two goals from Maluleka’s well-delivered corner kicks. Sede Junior Dion scored his first goal in the Usuthu colours, making it 3-0 at the stroke of half-time. Chiefs striker Caleb Bimenyimana missed a penalty which could have made it 1-1 early in the game. In the second half, Chiefs tried to fight back, but they could not get past AmaZulu’s defence. It looked like the game would end with a 3-0 score line until the last minute of the match, where Bongi Ntuli nailed the final nails in Amankhosi’s coffin making it 4-0. Talking after the match, Man of the match Mphahlele said they knew that Chiefs were shaky when it comes to defending set pieces. “I think it was a solid performance. We took our chances,” stated Mphahlele. “I told George to put a good delivery on the set pieces we will attack it as we seen that they are a bit shaky when it comes to defending.” This was the second time this season that Amakhosi lost a league match 4-0. Mamelodi Sundowns also beat them by the same scoreline at the beginning of the season.
