Matriculant sangoma Sisonke Makopo (19) from Siphamandla High School in Khayelitsha thanks her ancestors for helping her to scoop a bachelor pass. She said it was not an easy journey, but she worked hard and always asked her ancestors for guidance and it paid off. “I would tell them always when I go out to the exam room so that they can guide me in the exam. I knew they won’t write for me but all I asked them was to remind me about everything that I had studied,” she said. Sisonke passed with a bachelor and obtained a one distinction. She said she worked day and night to achieve the bachelor so that she followed her dream to be a paramedic. “I had a study group with other learners whereby we study and encourage each other. I’m happy that our efforts paid off,” she said. ALSO READ: PICS: Mpumalanga’s top matric achiever bags car! She said whenever she did not understand something she would make it a point that she goes to the teacher to get clarity. She also said lots of revisions towards exams played a key role in her passing. Sisonke told Daily Sun that the remaining headache is for her to get a place to study. “It’s a pity that I have applied at CPUT, but I was told that the place is already full. I have passed but that is the only headache remaining, I want the place to study this year,” she said. Another learner from the school Kwanda Ngcukaitobi(18) scooped five distinctions. “I have been waiting for this moment, I’m happy that my hard work paid off. I had sleepless nights. I was nervous waiting for these results,” he said. He said he has been accepted at the University of Pretoria, Wits University, and University of Johannesburg.
