The 45-year-old listened attentively when prosecutor Aurelia Makukule told the Mpumalanga court he was facing very serious charges, including murder, armed robbery with aggravating circumstances, possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition and pointing a firearm. The suspect, who told magistrate Tsakani Usinga that he was not intending to plead guilty, opted for Legal Aid representation. Cops pounced on him on 26 December in Mkhuhlu, Bushbuckridge, after he allegedly shot Aby Nginindza (40) dead at a tavern at about 3.30am.  Police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said upon arrival on the scene, cops found the victim lying on the ground with a gunshot wound to the head but he was still alive. An ambulance was called but family members decided to transport him to a nearby hospital themselves. “On arrival, the wounded man was unfortunately certified dead. A murder case was opened and the police traced the suspect,” he said. “During his arrest, he was found in possession of a firearm with ammunition as well as suspected stolen cash.” You must be
