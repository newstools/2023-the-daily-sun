MORE than 500 poor villagers and orphans have gone into the new year with hope. On Friday, 23 December, they received food parcels and clothes from the Dr BF Chauke Foundation at Malamulele Stadium in Limpopo. The foundation was founded by President Cyril Ramaphosa’s political advisor Bejani Chauke, who was orphaned at the age of five. The villagers were happy and said they had not expected to receive anything for the festive season. One by one, the villagers lined up with smiles on their faces to receive their gifts from Chauke. Chauke said the foundation helped struggling villagers and orphans running child-headed households and other children dependent on social grants. “We gave them food parcels and Christmas clothes. “Children who have both parents but receive support grants because their parents are unemployed also received gifts,” he said. The foundation has helped pupils with school uniforms and students with costs not covered by the National Student Financial Aid Scheme. “Growing up without parents made me realise life is very hard for most people, so I had to do something to help them relieve their stress over where their next meal will come from,” said Chauke. Gogo Midlayi Chauke (93) was overwhelmed with happiness. “I thought I would have a bad festive season because I’m poor, but Chauke came through for us. May God bless him,” she said.
