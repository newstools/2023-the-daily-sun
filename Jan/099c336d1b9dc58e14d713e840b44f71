JODY Botha apologised to angry ANC members outside the Meyerton Magistrates Court for assaulting Mpho Mbhele and calling him the K-word. ANC supporters flocked to court on Monday, 9 January, as the trial began. Botha assaulted and dragged Mbhele (38) on 17 October, and Daily Sun reported the story after a video of the incident went viral. Mbhele was assisted by political parties to lay charges against Botha, who was described as mentally ill by his friends. He is facing an assault charge, and his lawyer asked for the case to be postponed to gather more information. It was postponed to 9 February. ANC Midvaal sub-region chairman Mpumelelo Mthimkulu told Daily Sun they were happy to see the case was in court as many involving white people in the Midvaal did not make it there.

Mbhele was assaulted after being taken from his workplace at a restaurant, and dragged on the streets while being called the K-word. Botha had been drinking. He fought with Mbhele’s manager. When the manager tried to calm him down, he got furious and started swearing at Mbhele and assaulting him. Though he did not attend the case as he was at work, he told the SunTeam that he was glad it was in court. “I think I will get back my dignity after this man has been sentenced,” he said.
