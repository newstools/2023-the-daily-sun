THEY have been friends since the late 1970s and still are, even today. Gogo Aida Kwana and gogo Zodwa Qwili said they were friends for life. The 94-year-olds, from Boystown in Nyanga, met when they were in a street committee during the formation of Crossroads. “We worked together in a committee that was fighting for houses and the well-being of the community. Back then, the apartheid government burnt our structures but we rebuilt them. It was not an easy time. “Our community leader at the time, Johnson Ngxobongwana, encouraged us to rebuild despite the challenges,” said Aida. The gogos said they spent time together and accompanied each other to the clinic and shops. They sometimes cooked and hosted each other at their homes, about 500m apart. “We cannot have enough of each other because we have a lot to talk about as we shared a lot of life experiences,” said Aida.  The gogos said they were happy now that people had houses as they fought for that. And though they wished everyone could get a space and home, the two elderly women were not happy with the current situation in Nyanga. “We were fighting for people to have homes and live in peace, but now communities are terrorised by criminals. As old as we are, we are not safe even in our homes because of criminals. That is not the Nyanga we have been fighting for,” said Aida. Gogo Zodwa said despite the challenges they faced, she was happy that Aida was still alive.

Aida and I have been friends and God kept us both alive. It is something that I’m grateful about,” said Zodwa. She lamented that crime had taken over their kasi. She said they achieved what they were fighting for, but they never expected things to be what they were today. “We thought if people get homes and services there will be no crime, but we were wrong,” said Zodwa.
