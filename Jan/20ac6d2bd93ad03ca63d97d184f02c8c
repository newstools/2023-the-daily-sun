GOOD Samaritan Matsorwane Sekgopo (50) strives to ensure that no one in his village goes to bed on an empty stomach. Matsorwane from Ga-Sekgopo outside Modjadjiskloof, Limpopo, recently raised money through a fun walk and run, and managed to donate 50 food parcels to families on Saturday, 7 January. He is now raising money through his Matsorwane Sekgopo Foundation to buy school uniform and stationery for 280 pupils whose parents are unemployed. This means 20 pupils from each of the 14 schools in the village will benefit.

Most are brilliant but because they don’t have uniform and when they fail, they turn into bullies while others drop out.” Matsorwane said he wanted to build a community where everyone was equal. He’s pleading with partners and business people to help him buy the uniform, to be distributed away in March. “Proper uniform will inspire pupils to work hard so they can get out of poverty. We hope we will get support so we can change their lives,” he added.
