CAROLINE Tlhale (32) from Sebokeng zone 6, Vaal, told Daily Sun that the Sedibeng Department of Education and several schools around Evaton and Sebokeng have refused her son access to study. She claimed they said they didn’t accept pupils who are repeating grades. Tlhale said her son, Teboho Mthembu (17), has been staying with his gogo in the Free State and she decided to bring her son to Sebokeng. But she said when she tried to register her son, who is going to repeat grade 10, the first school she went to told her that they don’t take kids who are repeating a grade and she thought they were joking. She said she went back the following day and they told her the same thing. According to Tlhale, she went to Department of Education and asked the department to place her son at a school, but she was also told that the department is not working with pupils who have relocated to the region and also that they won’t place a pupil who is repeating a grade. She said she was told the only thing the pupil should do was to go back to his previous school. Tlhale said she’s is worried that her son won’t be able to go to school. Gauteng Department of Education spokesman Steve Mabona said pupils are allowed to repeat. However, he said Gauteng schools are full and they appeal to parents who seek space for inner grades to interact with schools from Wednesday, 25 January as the department was waiting for the 10-day head count, which lapses on Tuesday 24 January, he said. Mabona said the department will guide pupil placement accordingly.
