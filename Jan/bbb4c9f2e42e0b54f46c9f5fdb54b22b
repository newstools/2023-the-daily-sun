ACTRESS Fanele Ntuli has filled the gap on Uzalo. But she said she’s filling big shoes as she has replaced Omuhle Gela, who played the role of Nomaswazi Magwaza. Omuhle left the show following a disagreement about her contract conditions. Fanele (31) from Durban, KZN, said that replacing Omuhle is a big deal for her.

She said as much as she gets nervous on set, she tries to pull herself together. “The thing is that I don’t want people to remember someone else when they see me. It’s challenging. I need to impress both producers and fans. As an artist, I guess, so far, I’m doing it,” said Fanele. She is known as Dr Zondo on Durban Gen, which airs on e.tv and is currently on holiday break.

The two characters are different, but I can somehow relate to them. “I believe that I’m a go-getter. I hope that I nail Nomaswazi’s role and viewers are enjoying what they see,” said Fanele, who added that her acting journey started in theatre.
