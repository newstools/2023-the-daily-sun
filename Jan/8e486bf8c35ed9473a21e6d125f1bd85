A MOTORIST jumped over a bridge at midnight on 1 January to escape the police. The incident happened in Hillbrow, Joburg, while the police were conducting Operation Okae Molao, which saw hundreds of people arrested for various crimes across Gauteng. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela told Daily Sun the motorist was seriously injured but when he recovered, he will be investigated. He said his fingerprints will be checked to establish if he was wanted on any charges. National commissioner General Fannie Masemola said he was satisfied with the work done to ensure the festive season was safe for everyone. He said the Safer Festive Season plan focused on six areas, including GBV, aggravated armed robbery, border security and road safety. “With the addition of more boots on the ground following the deployment of 10 000 newly-trained constables, police have been hard at work heightening police visibility through joint law enforcement crime combatting operations, including patrols, stop and searches, roadblocks, and the tracing of wanted suspects,” said Masemola. Between 1 December and 31 December, there were 2 940 arrests of undocumented immigrants, 2 729 for drug-related crimes, 628 for driving under the influence of alcohol, 305 people were charged with murder, and 527 suspects were arrested for sexual offences.
