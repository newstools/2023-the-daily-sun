THAMI Ntuli is calling on municipalities affected by load reduction to take Eskom to court. The chairman of the KZN South African Local Government Association (Salga) said municipalities indebted to the power utility had to deal with the double burden of load shedding and load reduction, severely harming local economies. Ntuli said Eskom had no business reducing the load in these municipalities as plans had been agreed upon to settle their debt. “The practice of load reduction for municipalities that owe Eskom is a mockery of development. Similarly, households depend on municipalities. If one party fails in this supply chain and does not play their part, the system fails,” he said. “Eskom must not deprive households of their fundamental service rights, especially without following due process.” Ntuli said some of the affected municipalities were in rural areas where residents didn’t pay for services and municipalities had to raise money from grants to settle debts.

He said the Ulundi Local Municipality in KZN planned to approach the court for relief, but was able to sit down with Eskom and discuss a solution to the matter, leading to load reduction being scrapped in the area.
