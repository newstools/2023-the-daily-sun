THE summer initiation season came to an end over the weekend. Daily Sun was invited to the mountains by Sedibeng Initiation Traditional Surgeons Committee and Tau Diarora organisation to witness the mass graduation of young men who completed weeks of initiation. The initiates are from various kasis in the Vaal, including Polokong, Sebokeng and Evaton. As per tradition, the initiation camp was set alight on Friday, 6 January, and left to burn to indicate the end of initiation.

Solomon Mofokeng, chairman of Sedibeng Initiation Traditional Surgeons Committee, said he has been running initiation schools for many years on the mountains on the outskirts of the Vaal. Mofokeng said they are happy no boys died or were hospitalised. “There are illegal initiation schools out to destroy the cultural practice of initiation. “We are doing our best to fight abductions and illegal schools together with the police,” he said. “In all the years working with initiates, none have died in my care or ended up in hospital. “Sadly, there are groups out there who are destroying this beautiful process of initiation by abducting boys and charging families huge amounts of money.” Pheello Mollo, chairman of Tau Diarora, an organisation that supports initiation culture, said all his initiates were warned about unruly behaviour and advised to become lawful residents. “In recent times, initiation schools in the Vaal have been making the news for all the wrong reasons with cases of murder and abduction after young boys were killed in illegal initiation schools,” said Mollo.
