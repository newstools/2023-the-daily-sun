THIS year, Dr Rita Teka will celebrate her birthday with a twist. She will launch her recently established foundation, inspired by a recent encounter with Daily Sun, to help children from poor backgrounds with high-quality eye care. The leading optometrist and philanthropist will be hosting a golf day birthday celebration on 24 February to raise funds. The Limpopo-born doctor, who has been in the health industry for 24 years, said golfers, friends, businesspeople and companies were welcome to celebrate and donate. “The idea to start the Rita Teka Foundation, aimed at helping kids who are visually impaired, came after I worked with the People’s Paper last year. It approached me to help a child from Tembisa, who was bullied and suffered some injuries. I realised that I can do more to make a difference.” As a start, Teka will ask people to donate their old spectacles and use the frames to help make spectacles for children. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! This would save money as they would not have to buy new frames. “I have seen bright kids lose their future because of eye problems. I’m urging people and organisations to come on board. I’ll do eye tests for free with the help of sponsors, who will be able to get spectacles.” Teka’s dream is to have a mobile clinic with equipment to help visit communities.
