AS THE matric class of 2022 gets ready to register at higher learning institutions after receiving their exam results, the Minister of Higher Education, Science and Innovation, Blade Nzimande, has put measures in place to ensure the smooth beginning of the academic year of 2023. Nzimande has assured the current and prospective students that the release and announcement of matric results would not affect the state of readiness for the post-school education and training for 2023. He said university registrations started on 16 January and would close on 20 February. He said there would be several universities that would allow late registrations.  “Prospective students are advised to continue to liaise with the universities of their choice through their communication channels. Most of our Technical, Vocational and Training Colleges (TVET) have commenced with their teaching and learning following a successful online registration process. Some of the colleges are still accepting students in areas where the enrolment targets are not met,” he said. Nzimande said the department was monitoring the developments at each college. He said community colleges opened on 11 January for inland provinces and on 18 January for coastal provinces. “Prospective students are advised to go to their colleges of choice for registration for the 2023 academic year.
