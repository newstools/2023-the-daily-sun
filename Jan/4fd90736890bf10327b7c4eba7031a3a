FORMER drug addict and nyaope smoker, Tshegofatso Mahlangu, said he wanted to impress his friends – and it started with smoking zol. The 26-year-old from Mashimong in Hammanskraal, Tshwane said in 2018 he started living on the streets. He had begun stealing his family’s property like clothes, tools and other valuables to sell so he was booted out of his home. He survived by selling recycling materials to buy drugs. He said in mid-2019, he decided to go back to his mother and asked for forgiveness. Tshegofatso told Daily Sun that in 2019 he went to his mother and pleaded with her to give him just two days to prove he will change and quit drugs. Then God spoke to him. “My mother gave me the opportunity but it was difficult. The second day being home, after smoking with a friend, I heard the voice of God saying I must leave the drugs,” he said. “I started reading the Bible there and then. I felt the love of God and started praying and fasting.” He started preaching and praying for drug addicts.  He said that since then he has never taken drugs again and he is proud that he is rehabilitated. “My parents have forgiven me. They told me that whatever I’ve been doing, I was only hurting and destroying myself,” said Tshegofatso. He said drug addicts often blame their family members for making them make wrong decisions. “I am writing a book to tell the story that there is always time to turn back and do the right thing,” he said He said if one wants to rehabilitate themselves, they must restore their minds.
