TWO suspects appeared in court yesterday, 4 January, for being caught in possession of suspected stolen vehicles. Alberto Fundzama (25) and Marcelino Langa (43), both originally from Mozambique, were not asked to plead by the Bushbuckridge Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga. The matter was rolled over to today for a formal bail application. The pair was allegedly in possession of two suspected stolen Toyota Hilux bakkies. Their appearance came a week after they were denied bail. Police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said cops pounced on the two after they were seen trying to avoid police operations on the route to the Kruger National Park. He said they entered the park via the Numbi Gate and it was suspected they were trying to avoid police operations on the N4.

Feeling free in the park, they decided to rest at the Afsaal Picnic Site. “Tracker had already picked up a signal from one of the vehicles and the suspects enjoyed their last day of freedom to the fullest,” said Mohlala. He said the tracking company alerted the cops and Sanpark security personnel, who intercepted one of the cars. One of the suspects was bust and told police a second vehicle was stolen, leading to the arrest of the second suspect. “Both vehicles, Toyota Hilux, were reported stolen in Delmas and Daveyton, Gauteng, in December 2022,” said Mohlala. “The stolen vehicles were already fitted with false registration plates. Police cannot rule out the possibility that other charges will be added as the investigation continues.” Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela warned criminals that they could not hide from the cops.
