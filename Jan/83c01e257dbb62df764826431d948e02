A DRIVER fled the scene of an accident on Saturday, 7 January, after running over nine pedestrians, killing three. Alfred Taruvinga (44), whose four-year-old twin daughters died, said the driver was drunk and reckless. He said his wife Elelwani Khomora (34) and kids, Munei and Munewa Khomora, were visiting a friend in Salvokop, Tshwane, and were hit by a BMW sedan while walking back at around 5pm. His wife was injured but survived. Alfred said he suspected the driver was drunk as a bottle of alcohol was found in the car. He said he was told the driver was spinning his car on the street. Josphat Pareyi (37), whose daughter Privilege (4) also died in the accident, said he was still in shock. “My wife Anna Sithole (27) was walking with my daughter.
