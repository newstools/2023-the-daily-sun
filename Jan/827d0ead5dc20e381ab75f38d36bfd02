KAIZER Chiefs have dismissed reports that the club could face another Fifa ban over the transfer of Teenage Hadebe. On Monday reports were making rounds claiming that Chiefs were ordered by Fifa’s tribunal to pay Hadebe’s former club Chicken Inn R370,000 over his transfer from Naturena to Turkish side Yeni Malatyaspor. The report originated in the Bulawayo-based Sunday News and said the dispute was over a sell-on fee in Hadebe’s contract. Hadebe, now plays for Houston Dynamo in US Major League Soccer, joined Chiefs in July 2017 before moving to Malatyaspor in Turkey in July 2019. Hadebe is now on the books of Major League Soccer side joined Malatyaspor for an undisclosed fee, with Chicken Inn seemingly taking Chiefs to Fifa due to an alleged clause in the deal with Chiefs to receive a percentage of his transfer fee. The report alleged that Chiefs would be banned from the transfer market for up to three windows, should they refuse to pay the outstanding amount. However, Amakhosi have moved swiftly to rubbiosh the reports. “Kaizer Chiefs note the reports that are making rounds relating to the transfer of Teenage Hadebe,’ said the club in a brief statement. ‘Some news reports say: “Initially, indications are that Hadebe joined the Turkey club as a free agent. However, it was unearthed that the Arthur Zwane coached-side indeed sold him, albeit for an undisclosed fee.”Chiefs statement added: “The Club would like to categorically dismiss the reports as flawed and misleading” “Kaizer Chiefs have fulfilled all the obligations in the transfer of Hadebe.” In 2020 Chiefs were banned from signing players for two transfer windows. This was after they lost their appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) following a Fifa punishment in December over the signing of Malagasy player Andriamirado Aro Hasina Andrianamimanana.
