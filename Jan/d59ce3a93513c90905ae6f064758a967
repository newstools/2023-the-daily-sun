THE KZN government has come under fire over the funeral of kwaito singer Mandla “Mampintsha” Maphumulo. This comes after a Facebook post claiming the provincial government spent R50 million on the service went viral. KZN promoter and Mampintsha’s friend, Lindo “Dog Durban” Buthelezi, accused the provincial government of being opportunistic, giving him a lavish funeral while he was struggling when he was still alive. Premier Nomusa Dube-Ncube came out in defence of the government, revealing that the provincial government spent R170 000 on sponsoring the funeral. She said the arts and culture department gave R50 000, while the eThekwini Municipality gave R100 000. ALSO READ : Uzalo actor - I woke up with lice on my 4-5! Dube-Ncube said the government condemned those peddling fake news. “We urge the people of this province not to take everything that is published on social media platforms at face value and only to believe news originating from credible and reputable media houses that are obliged to subject their news content to professional and ethical checks and balances,” she said. Meanwhile, Dog Durban posted a statement to social media, which he later removed.

When she was an MEC for cooperative governance and traditional affairs, she booked them. “I also know that other KZN departments continuously booked Big Nuz,” he said.
