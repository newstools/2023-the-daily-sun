Royal AM bagged the bragging rights in the first KwaZulu-Natal derby of the year after defeating rivals AmaZulu 2-0 at the Chatsworth Stadium on Sunday.  Itâ€™s a welcome win for AM who have finally broken their worrying winless streak of four matches in the league and will now look to keep climbing up the Premiership table.  And their misfiring attack, which was exposed in their goalless draw against TS Galaxy last time out, needed to rediscover their scoring boots to get maximum points against Usuthu. The result might have done wonders for AM, but it will be one to forget for Romain Folz and his Usuthu side who continue to struggle for consistency. Usuthu have not hit the heights expected this season, claiming just a single victory in their last five matches with two defeats and three draws.  Folz will now hope that his Usuthu side bounce back strong when they face wounded Kaizer Chiefs at Moses Mabhida Stadium on Friday (7.30pm).
