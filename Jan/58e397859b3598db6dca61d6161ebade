AMAKHOSI have been showing love to children and the community at large. The Traditional Council in Wallmannsthal, Tshwane, donated school uniform to disadvantaged community members on Wednesday, 18 January. Peter Mushwana, a headman and secretary of the Royal Council of Ndzundza Mushwana Traditional Council, said they realised that something needed to be done to make a difference in the area. “Many children in the area are struggling with school uniform,” he said, adding that they donated at Kodumela Primary School in Pyramid. “We wish to do this on an annual basis. Over 100 pupils benefited from this initiative,” he said. The headman said the council could play a role in building the future of children. Headwoman Sylvia Mmatshipyane said they would continue to help kids. “We would also love to help children from Hlanganani Secondary School and others,” she said, adding that Kodumela needed urgent help. Ndlunkulu Veronica Mushwana, the wife of Chief Duvazi Joe Mushwana, said she had a soft spot for children and women.  “These children are our future, and this is the part where we have to break generational curses,” she said, urging parents to teach their kids to dream big. “It doesn’t matter how dusty our streets are, this is the beginning of a fresh, clear and new relationship.” Chief Duvazi thanked the community for coming together in the name of all kids. “I need these children to go to school looking beautiful, and make a difference in our community. They will be leading tomorrow,” he said. Vincent Rakgoale, departmental head at Kodumela, thanked the traditional council. “Our children are the poorest in the district. This is something good for them, and they are happy.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments  Anna Mogiva (41), a parent of two children who received uniform, said she was happy.
