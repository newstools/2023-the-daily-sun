THE giant pothole in the middle of Molefe Makinta Highway in Winterveld, Tshwane, has been fixed and the entire kasi is celebrating! Residents were calling the pothole a swimming pool in the middle of the road. The pothole was fixed by the Gauteng Department of Roads and Transport last month after Daily Sun published the story on 19 November. Resident Sakkie Maseko (37) told Daily Sun that last year he was trying to fill up the pothole with sand so that it wouldn’t cause serious accidents. He said the hole kept on opening up because of rain, and was always full of water. The residents were worried as they were endangered by cars which were trying to avoid the pothole and coming straight for pedestrians. Motorists were complaining that their cars were being damaged. Happy resident Richard Dube (55), said it was good to see traffic flowing nicely on the road. He said: “Now the road is safe and motorists are not complaining anymore.”  Paul Makhubela (48) said they were happy that at last, the pothole has been fixed. “It was a serious concern to us,” he said. Motorist Simon Malatji (35) said: “We are happy to see the road repaired. “It was a headache for us as our cars were being damaged.
