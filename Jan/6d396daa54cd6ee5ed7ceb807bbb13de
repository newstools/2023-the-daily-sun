NDEBELE music icon Dr Nothembi Mkhwebani was born and raised on the farms by her grandparents. She didn’t go to school but herded cattle and goats. She said at the age of five when she was supposed to start school, her mum unfortunately died. The music icon said she had to learn to play the guitar in the bush after being taught by her uncle. She said when she started her music career, she couldn’t read or write. But today she boasts has a matric certificate that she wrote when she was 65 years old in 2015. “My grandparents didn’t see the importance of sending me to school. When I began my music career I was illiterate. I was made to sign contracts that I didn’t even understand. When I travelled abroad, I couldn’t communicate with the people there. I would only talk to those who accompanied me,” she said. “Later in my music career I realised that I needed to go to school. I enrolled for an ABET. I started my educational journey from grade three. I wrote four matric subjects in 2015 and I passed them. I finished the last two in 2020.” Dr Nothembi told Daily Sun that ever since she obtained her matric, she’s now able to read and understand every document put in front of her.
