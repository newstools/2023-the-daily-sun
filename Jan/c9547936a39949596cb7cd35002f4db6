AZAPO is calling on the justice system to treat Zandile Mafe like any other citizen. Mafe was arrested in January last year after being accused of starting a fire that burnt down Parliament in Cape Town. The party believed Mafe, who faces charges of terrorism, arson, housebreaking, theft and possession of explosives, was used as a pawn and the real culprit is still out there. He has been denied bail by the Western Cape High Court twice. Azapo publicity secretary Gaontebale Nodoba said Mafe had not been found guilty of any crime, but he was being kept behind bars. He said there was no reason for him not to be released on bail. “Azapo has ensured Mafe is in the public eye and receives a fair trial. As a defender of black dignity and poor black people, Azapo has been consistent in calling out those who mete out injustice to poor, black and defenceless people like Mafe,” he said. Register and SIGN IN to read comments “Azapo will continue to pledge solidarity and support for Mafe in 2023, and will be there when he appears in court again in January.” Nodoba said the party maintained that Mafe was a scapegoat and if there was enough evidence to prove him guilty, the trial would have been completed within six months of his arrest. He said the charge of terrorism showed how low the state had gone in its abuse of him. “Azapo maintaints that the real culprits are still roaming around, and are being protected. The real masterminds behind the burning of Parliament, a national key point, are still to be unmasked,” he said. Meanwhile, Parliament spokesman Moloto Mothapo said plans for the rebuilding programme will be shared at a press conference soon.
