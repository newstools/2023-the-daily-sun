ANTI-GANG cops recently arrested two women with firearms and ammunition in Delft following a spate of violence in the area. The two women were arrested in two separate incidents. Cops spokesman Captain Frederick van Wyk said cops responded to a tip-off of guns at a house on Ebro Crescent and Okkerneut Street where the discoveries were made. Cops first went to Ebro Crescent where they searched the premises and found a gun and ammunition hidden in the right wheel of a vehicle parked at the house. They then left and came back to the same house and found a woman in possession of a firearm. “Further intelligence took the team back to an address in Ebro Crescent. A thorough search of the premises was conducted and a woman was arrested for being in possession of a 9mm firearm with the serial number removed and eight rounds of ammunition was confiscated and booked in as exhibits,” said Van Wyk. With more information, cops went to Okkerneut Street and conducted another search. Another woman was arrested after cops discovered firearms and ammunition. “The team followed up more information and proceeded to an address in Okkerneut Street. An adult woman was arrested for being in possession of a double barrel 12 gauge shotgun and five 12 bore rounds were confiscated and booked in as exhibits,” said Van Wyk. Cops managed to arrest two wanted suspects in the same kasi, who were wanted in connection with a murder case.
