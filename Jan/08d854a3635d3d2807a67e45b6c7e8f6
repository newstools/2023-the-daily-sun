A TRANSFORMER fell on a 13-year-old girl while walking in the street in Khuma, North West. The incident, that happened on Tuesday 17 January, has angered the community and Tshimologo Phale’s family. Katlego Molobeng said the transformer was still on top of Tshimologo when he arrived. “We tried to get it off. Some people were afraid to help as they thought the power would shock them, unaware that we had load- shedding,” said Katlego. “I’m still wondering what would have happened if the power was on. Maybe we could have lost that girl. This pole was reported to Eskom so it can be fixed, but this has not happened. Was Eskom waiting for this to happen?” Aunt Boitumelo said after doing schoolwork at home, Tshimologo walked her friends out. “She is passionate about being a doctor, but it seems like her dreams are taken away,” said Boitumelo. Tshimologo’s home is almost 500m away from where the transformer was. Her uncle, Thapelo Msimanga, said they were saddened by what had happened. “Relevant authorities and Eskom must take responsibility for what happened,” he said. Eskom’s Zodwa Dlamini said they inspected poles annually as part of maintenance, the last time being in November. “We do not wait for an incident to happen but address defects found from the inspection,” said Dlamini. She said they were investigating the incident to establish the actions required.
