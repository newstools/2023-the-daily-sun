MOST schools in Mzansi will be resuming the 2023 academic year on Wednesday, 11 January. With schools reopening, parents are facing the music as stress levels increase. According to some parents from Soweto, Gauteng, they’re struggling to cope with the back to school demands as January is a tough month. Speaking to Daily Sun, Martha Dube, a parent from Fox Lake in Dlamini, said she is frustrated. “I am a single parent. My children depend on me for their school expenses. I was saving throughout 2022 for this moment, but it seems as if it’s not enough. School uniform on its own is expensive, and then there’s stationery too which can cost up to R2 000 including textbooks. It’s too much,” said Martha Martha said at some point, she was considering sending children at a government school. “I have once gone to a nearby school to enquire but I was not impressed. I want my children to have access to good education, but sometimes I feel like it is so expensive, and you can’t avoid not buying some essentials,” she said.

Linda Dibodu, who is a parent to a toddler, said she was so surprised when she received a list of things that were requested by the school. “If school fees for a toddler is this expensive, how much will I be paying when he goes to a proper school?” said Linda.
