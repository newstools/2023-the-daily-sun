THE driver of the gas tanker that exploded in Boksburg, and his employer, may face both criminal charges and civil claims. This was revealed during the press briefing held in Joburg on Thursday, 12 January. To date, 40 people, including health workers, have died from the explosion that occurred on 24 December when the truck got stuck under a low-lying bridge. Several properties, including the Tambo Memorial Hospital, were damaged during the incident. The truck is owned by Infinite Transport Group. Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi promised to try and complete the refurbishment of the hospital in four weeks. He said the government would also help regarding the burial of the victims. The driver was arrested on Christmas Day but released shortly afterwards because of insufficient evidence. However, Lesufi said 40 witnesses had now come forward.
