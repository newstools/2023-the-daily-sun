The father of six said his artwork puts food on the table. “I am enjoying my work and I will continue to do it as a means of survival,” said Mark. He said every day is a new day for him and he keeps learning new things. “This work needs one to believe in themself and one to swallow your pride and ask when they need help,” he said. Mark is thankful for the people who continue to support him. “People love my work and cannot stop praising it. My biggest dream is to have a workshop and teach young people about fine arts,” he said. One of his customers, Boipelo Kgarume from Soshanguve, said she has already bought two paintings from Mark. “I love his artwork because it’s colourful and attractive,” she said.
