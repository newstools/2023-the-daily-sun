TWO boys, aged 12 and 15, have been arrested by Sharpeville police after they allegedly raped and assaulted a 61-year-old gogo on Christmas Day. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo told Daily Sun the alleged rape and assault took place at the gogo’s home in Sharpeville, Vaal. Masondo said the gogo met the boys on her way back from the shops. “The woman took them to her house after they claimed to be looking for their parents and it was already dark,” he said. “While at the gogo’s house, the boys allegedly started assaulting the old woman and then raped her.” According to Masondo, the boys then fled and went into hiding. “The gogo went to the Sharpeville Police Station to report the matter. The police hunted the boys down and found them at their hiding place on 26 December, where they were arrested,” said Masondo. The suspects appeared in the Vereeniging Magistrates Court for rape and assault. “They were released in the care of their parents until their next court appearance,” added Masondo.
