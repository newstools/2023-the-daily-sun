INKATHA Freedom Party (IFP) president Velenkosini Hlabisa has instructed the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) to close their doors which they said were still open for coalition discussions. He said their doors are officially shut for any coalition discussion with the EFF as their marriage has officially broken. The ugly divorce between the two came after the IFP refused to surrender the City of uMhlathuze, which is one of the big municipalities in the province as it is classified as the second biggest business hub to their then coalition partners, EFF. Hlabisa said they won’t be threatened or pushed by any party into a corner in return for their support. Hlabisa was speaking during the media briefing in Durban on Monday, 30 January. The briefing was called in response to EFF leader, Julius Malema, publicly instructing all their deputy mayors in KZN who benefited from the position due to the coalition they established to immediately resign as their coalition agreement had come to an end. “IFP will not be threatened by any political party and we will not be pushed in any corner. We will not betray the trust of the voters who have put their trust in us. “Good luck to the EFF in its intended marriage with the failed ANC to deliver services in our country,” said Hlabisa. Hlabisa said EFF can go as the IFP is not desperate and they are focusing on growing their footprint. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! “We remain with our dignity and ethics and we will not compromise and get into an unholy alliance. The EFF can go. We are not desperate. We will continue to meet the needs of our people as we are doing on a daily basis,” said Hlabisa. He further clarified that the party will only lose one municipality as a result of the end of the coalition with the EFF and not 13 as it had previously predicted.
