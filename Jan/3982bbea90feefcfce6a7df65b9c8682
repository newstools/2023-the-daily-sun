A MPUMALANGA school has been left in a desperate situation after thugs broke in and cleaned out feeding scheme supplies meant for pupils. This happened in the early hours of Thursday morning, 12 January. The thugs, who gained entry through a fence, ransacked Sinqobile Primary School in Louisville and made off with the food meant for 400 pupils. The food was delivered on Wednesday, 11 January. According to Abednigo Magongo, chairman of the SGB, the school’s security guard was told not to move from where he was when the group of unknown men entered the school’s kitchen through a window. Magongo said the thugs took almost an hour to carry out the job. He said this has left the parents and the community very angry. “The worst part is that this food has to last the school the whole month. Now our children will starve because of selfish people. Most of the pupils here can’t buy lunch or bring lunch boxes. They eat here at the school and some even take food home,” he said.  Parent Ndumiso Mbaze said they don’t know why would people steal food meant to benefit their own children. “We have assembled a team from the community that will go house to house to search for the food. We are doing this because we believe that the people behind this are from our community. We will also visit all the shops around here. We want the food back,” he said.  Mpumalanga police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdluli said the cops are investigating a case of business burglary. He said they’re looking for the suspects and urge anyone with information to come forward.
