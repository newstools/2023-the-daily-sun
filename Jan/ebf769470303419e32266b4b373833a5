ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa has honoured the two young men who were assaulted by a group of old men in a racial attack at Maselspoort Resort in Bloemfontein on 25 December last year. A video of the attack made rounds on social media, and three men were arrested. One was charged with attempted murder, this after he tried to drown one of the boys.

Ramaphosa called the two brothers onto the stage and said they were his guests. He thanked them for their courage to stand up for themselves when they were being attacked. “The message I want to give to you is that the spirit of our forebears who fought against the apartheid system must fill you with courage as it does all of us. “To those in our country who still want to perpetuate racism, we say today that we do not want racists in South Africa. If you want to practice your racist tendencies, South Africa is not the place to come and do that,” he said. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments
