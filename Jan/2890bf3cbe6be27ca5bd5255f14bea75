NTATE Kganyago is a wanted man on the run on Skeem Saam. It turns out his real name is Mathias Mamba, and he’s been scamming women around SA. He made Jacobeth fall in love with him and then scammed her of her pension – a whopping R1 million. He also kidnapped her daughter, Lizzy, who luckily managed to escape after being left for dead. While cops are hunting for him, he’s busy getting loans at various banks using Jacobeth’s identity.

Meanwhile, Bishop Mbatha is the true definition of moruti wa tsotsi. He’s taken his dream of owning his own church too far. He converted a tavern into a church, then invited the community to wine and dine with him for mahala – or so they thought. When the night was over and after his guest, gospel star Ayanda Ntanzi, had performed, he told everyone to pay R500 for their meal. He placed a bodyguard at the door so no one would leave until they paid up. This conman’s church will flop before it even gets off the ground.
