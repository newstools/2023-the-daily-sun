A MAN was moered and burnt to death by an angry mob on Sunday, 29 January. This after he allegedly raped and killed an 11-year-old girl and hid her bloodied body in the bushes on the outskirts of Dingleydale Village outside Thulamahashe, Mpumalanga. The drama unfolded when the girl’s father left her with the man, who was his cousin, while he rushed to pay a taxi tariff. But the girl and the man were nowhere to be found when the father returned. He panicked and followed the man’s takkie tracks, which led him to a nearby mango orchard, but he only found his daughter’s wet panties with fresh blood. He then alerted the villagers who searched for the girl. They eventually found the man hiding in the reeds by the river and he confessed to raping and killing the girl. The angry mob moered the man and set him alight. The girl’s mum from Orinoco told Daily Sun her child’s dad took her for a visit at his place in Dingleydale. “I received a call from her panicked dad after a few hours that she had disappeared with his cousin. But I didn’t believe his story. This is a well-planned thing. How could he give my daughter to his criminal cousin, whom he knows is wanted by villagers in Acornhoek and the police for rape and murder,” she said. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! A community leader from Dingleydale Village said the man told the community members he was hiding in the village as the police and residents of Acornhoek were looking for him for ritual murder and raping his sisters and mother. “The mob got angry and hit him with anything they could find before setting his body on fire,” she said. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said police have opened two counts of murder and rape after a man was assaulted and burnt to death for allegedly raping and killing a girl in Dingleydale on Saturday. He said the 40-year-old father was detained for child neglect. He will appear in Mhala Magistrates Court on Tuesday.
