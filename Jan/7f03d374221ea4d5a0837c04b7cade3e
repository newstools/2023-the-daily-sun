A FIGHT has erupted in the Klerksdorp-based Matlosana Municipality in North West over the construction of a sports complex in extension 9 in Khuma. The tender was initially advertised at R42 million, however, the service provider is reportedly demanding R74 million. The municipality has already paid R54 million for the tender, which was also confirmed by Mayor James Ntsolela to Daily Sun. But according to opposition parties, the service provider demanded more money to complete the construction of the complex. Construction of the complex started in 2020.  But the opposition in the council said the job that has already been done does not tally with the amount demanded. A guard house was reportedly built at R400 000, while a caretaker’s house was built at R800 000. DA’s Johannes Le Grange said: “They are now coming forward and asking for 20% which is already another R11 million. We say no, loud and clear. We’re going to say no. We’re not going to allow you to have excess money. What we want now is a complete investigation.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments EFF’s Fikile Oortman said now that public money had been used, people who were involved in approving the tender must be held accountable. Freedom Front Plus’ Fannie Kloppers said there were allegations of corruption and wasteful expenditure and they would get to the root cause. Ntsolela said although they complained about the awarding of the tender, the proper supply chain management procedure was followed by the municipality in awarding the tender. Asked if the work is complete, he said: “The current scope of work is 99% complete and we’ve received a further R10 million grant to adjust the current scope of work. The adjustment of the current scope of work will include paving, lights, and others.”
