 A
23-year-old young man Neo Kamogelo Rapiani, from Pimville Zone 2 in Soweto has
been missing since Saturday, 31 December 2022. His
family is asking for help with information that could assist in finding him. According
to his uncle Josi Rapiani, he was last seen on Saturday, 31 December 2022
around 5 pm in the afternoon at home when his family was making their way to
church, “When
he wasn’t found at home, we assumed that he went out with his friends since it
was New Year’s Eve,” Rapiani said. “Seeing
that he wasn’t back the next day, we thought he was probably still with his
friends and that he will eventually come back,” added. “At
the time of his disappearance, he was wearing grey sweatpants, a white top, and
a purple and white airforce,” said Rapiani. Rapiani
said Neo’s father has gone to the Kliptown Police Station to open a missing
persons case and to the Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital mortuary, Unfortunately,
they couldn’t pick up anything and his body was not at the mortuary. “His
parents are very stressed as they are searching for him all over.”  “He
is not one to disappear, so this is the first time we are encountering
something like this,” his uncle said. Rapiani
said they have also tried to liaise with Telkom to try and track Neo's last
contact number but were unsuccessful in doing so. Rapiani
said they were informed that the investigative officer should liaise with them
and that they will be able to assist us further. Cops
spokesman Captain Mavela Masondo confirmed the case. Masondo
confirmed that a missing person was reported at Kliptown Police Station and
that the search is underway. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments "Police
