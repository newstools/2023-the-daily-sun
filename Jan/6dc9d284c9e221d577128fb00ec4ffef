“WE are waiting for our day to die.” These were the words of ANC Gert Sibande regional secretary Maqhawe Mlotshwa (34). He said this following the death of ward 12 councillor Sbonelo Mthembu, ANC activist Sizwe Mbingo and mechanic Sabelo Nhleko. The three were gunned down in a yard in Longhomes township in Mkhondo, Mpumalanga, on Friday, 13 January. According to a police report, Mthembu and Nhleko were being dropped off by Mbingo when three armed men appeared in the yard. The suspects reportedly fired multiple shots at the councillor who was in the yard and fatally shot Mbingo who was still inside his bakkie. Meanwhile, Nhleko was shot while he was also in the yard. Thereafter the three suspects fled. Mlotshwa, who was with the trio earlier that day, said he believes the thugs mistook Nhleko for him. He said he believes that he survived the attack because he used a different car that day. He said that in November, Mthembu posted a video and made it clear that should anything happens to him, the public must know that he was assassinated by the former mayor. Mlotshwa said he believes these will be cold cases as police arrested no one in the murder of deputy chairman in the region Muzi Manyathi, who was gunned down in November. It is also reported that Mthembu signed a motion of no confidence last week during a council meeting in the Mkhondo Municipality against the current mayor, speaker and chief whip. Police spokesman Colonel Donald Mdluli said they have launched a manhunt for the killers. of the three men. He said a team of investigators has been assembled to specifically focus on political killings in Mkhondo.
