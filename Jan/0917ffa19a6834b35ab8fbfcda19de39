MADALA Toloki Alphiuose Mahunye needs help finding his family. The 68-year-old from Phomolong in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, said he spent his early life working for a farmer near Sekampaneng Village. Madala, who was born in Mahikeng in North West, told Daily Sun he had not seen his family since his brother died in 1990. He said he cut contact with them because he was unhappy that his brother was cremated without his knowledge. “I decided to isolate myself from them but as time goes by, I worry that I am getting old and my wife and kids might need them when I die,” he said. Madala said he remembered last seeing his family around the time former president Nelson Mandela was released from prison. He said he believed they were based in Mabopane. “This is all I can remember and I’m hoping the little information I have will be enough to find my family. I need them,” he said. The father of three said he was the eldest of a family of five. “My mum, who has died, was Dikeledi Mahunye, also known as Josta,” he said. Madala said his siblings were called Tlhopigi and Mmita Mokoena. “I’m really praying and hoping this story reaches the right people who will be able to help me find my family,” he said.
