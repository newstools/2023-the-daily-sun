 THERE’S a tiger on the loose in the Midvaal! The tiger injured Thabang Maseko (37) and ate several sheep and dogs at Daleside Farms in Midvaal, south of Joburg, in the early hours of Sunday morning. Sonti Maseko (49) told Daily Sun she heard her brother screaming as he walked outside her house. When she went outside holding a torch, she saw her brother lying on the ground, kicking and fighting with a tiger. “I flashed the torch at the tiger but it had already injured my brother and he was taken to Kopanong Hospital,” she said. Sonti said on Friday morning, community members were alerted that a tiger is on the loose and they thought it would be caught. “I thought I would rather risk being attacked by the tiger than leave my brother to be killed by the tiger,” she said. Thandi Maseko, who works for the owner of the tigers, said there’s no proper meat for the tigers. “We feed them chickens, but they get out through the fence as the stable is not the right place to cage two big tigers,” said Thandi. She said this time the female escaped and together with its owner, they searched for it. Maseko said on Friday the tiger killed several sheep and dogs on the farms and the owner told them that the tiger wants blood. “But we never thought it would attack a man,” said Thandi. Another employee told Daily Sun they have been complaining to their boss to remove the tigers and he tells them that they guard his wife as she stays alone. The SunTeam spoke to the owner who didn’t want to be named. “Thugs have been cutting the fence during the last four days trying to steal my tigers,” he said. He said he can’t comment further. Gauteng police spokeswoman Colonel Dimakatso Sello said people are urged to be alert after a tiger escaped from a plot in the Kliprivier area of Midvaal on Saturday. “It is reported that the tiger escaped from its cage and attacked a man.” She warned members of the public not to approach the animal.
