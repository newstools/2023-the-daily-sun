FORMER Gagasi FM content specialist Makhosi Khoza is joining Ukhozi FM as programmes manager. According to sources, he’s expected to start work next month. “Business manager Sbongi Ngcobo has always preferred Makosi. They’re both from Gagasi FM and Sbongi prefers to recruit her staff from Igagasi,” said a source. “Currently, a significant number of managers at Ukhozi FM, as well as presenters, are from Igagasi FM. It is concerning.” The position became vacant in October 2021 when the SABC terminated Zandile Tembe’s contract. According to sources, there was no acting programmes manager for a long period.
