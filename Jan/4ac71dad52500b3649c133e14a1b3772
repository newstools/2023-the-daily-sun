MADALA Joseph Mojola never got to see 2023. The 70-year-old from KwaMondi Village in Eshowe, northern KZN, died in a house fire on New Year’s Eve. It’s believed he fell asleep with a candle lit in his room. He lost his life and left his family without shelter. Neighbour Nonto Majola (40) said the madala was alone when the fire broke out as his grandchildren and daughter were asleep at a neighbour’s house. “We suspect he fell asleep while the candle was still lit because there was no electricity in the house. By the time people noticed flames coming out of the house, it was already too late,” she said. Nonto said the madala shared his last meal with his family at the neighbour’s house before heading home to sleep.

Nonto said the entire family was asleep at neighbour’s home as everyone was unemployed and no one could afford to fix the house. “They relied on madala’s pension grant and they don’t know where they will get money to bury him,” she said. Nonto said the family desperately needed help. She said they needed building materials, food and children’s school uniforms. Councillor Linda Ngema said it was the first time there was such a tragedy in the village. “It’s unfortunate that we have lost one of the elders we all respected in the village. We are still knocking on different doors to seek help,” said the councillor.
