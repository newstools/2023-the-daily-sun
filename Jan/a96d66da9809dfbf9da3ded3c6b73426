THE EFF has resolved to hold a national shutdown on 20 March to demand the return of electricity and for the resignation of President Cyril Ramaphosa. This was said by party leader Julius Malema after their 18th Central Command Team Meeting and fourth annual plenum of the second National People’s Assembly on Sunday evening, 29 January. Malema said the national shutdown means that there will be no schools, no universities, factories, and businesses will not be operating. He said that all municipalities and major cities will be shut down. “There will be no work on that day. All major roads will be barricaded and all ports of entry that lead to the borders will be closed. “The national shutdown, for the return of electricity and the resignation of Cyril Ramaphosa, will mean, no trucks and trains will be on the road or rail, particularly the train that will be transporting South Africa’s minerals and coal to outside South Africa through Richards Bay,” he said.

It is our constitutional right to protest,” said Malema.
