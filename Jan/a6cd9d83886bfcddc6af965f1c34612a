THE funeral service of Justice Lukheleni (25) could have been conducted on the street next to what could have been his home in Palm Ridge, Ekurhuleni. But residents did not allow that to happen. Instead, they forced their way into the house belonging to his mum in order to give him a decent burial. The house, in his mum’s name, was allegedly grabbed by her late boyfriend’s friend soon after she signed to move in. His friend allegedly took the keys from her and has been living there for five years. Martha Lukheleni (46) was forced to rent a shack and on 1 December, Justice was killed, allegedly by an angry mob. She could not carry the funeral at her mastandi’s place as she believed it was going to bring bad luck.  “This is my house and he’s refusing to get out. We tried to reason with him but he says it’s his,” she said, adding that her late boyfriend and his friend went with her to apply for a housing subsidy, where she signed documents. Martha said her boyfriend, who is the father to her four children, died two years before the house could be built. “I think he saw that I was vulnerable and my boyfriend was gone, so he demanded the keys.” She said the friend then took over the house.
