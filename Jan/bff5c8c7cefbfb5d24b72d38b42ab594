AN on-duty Mpumalanga traffic officer was killed by a truck on Monday, 9 January. Gijimane July Nkabinde (57) was attempting to pull over the truck at the Middelburg weigh bridge when it struck and killed him instantly. According Moeti Mmusi, the Department of Community Safety spokesman, it’s alleged that at the time the accident occurred, Nkabinde was directing the truck to the weigh bridge situated along the N4 toll road. “The investigation into the circumstances surrounding this tragedy is already underway,” he said.  Mmusi said the driver was arrested and charged with culpable homicide. Meanwhile, MEC Vusi Shongwe has sent his heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family, friends, and colleagues of Nkabinde. He has called on Nkabinde’s colleagues in the law enforcement fraternity not to be discouraged by this incident. He said they should rather continue working hard to deal with errant drivers as part of honouring the departed official. “Truck drivers must at all times cooperate with law enforcement officers because the directives of these officials supersede all other signs on the road. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments We have noticed that some truck drivers are at times not working with our officials. There’s a problem of attitude on some truck drivers who constantly disregard the rules. The attitude of some of these drivers must change and trucking companies must instil in their employees the culture of considerate and cautious driving,” said Shongwe.
