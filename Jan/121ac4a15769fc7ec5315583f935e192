THE search for Sheba, the tiger that escaped from its enclosure, on Friday, 13 January, continues. The tiger attacked a man and left several pigs and dogs dead at Daleside farms in the Midvaal, south of Joburg, on Friday morning. On Tuesday, 17 January, it was spotted on the mountains by drones and more people joined the search. Others, including journalists, camped at a water stream hoping it might go there for a drink of water. On Tuesday morning, the owner of the tiger, known as Rassie, shared a text message saying after the search was called off on Monday, 16 January, he put some meat at the door of his home and it was gone when he woke up in the morning, proving that Sheba is still around. Gresham Mandy, Community Policing Forum leader, said the tiger was spotted in its hiding spot on the mountains on Tuesday, but it was not yet captured.

The tiger will be captured by the end of the day and taken to a place of safety,” said Mandy. Department of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment issued a statement on Tuesday cautioning the community of Walkerville and surrounding areas to be vigilant.
