GATVOL residents of Jeffsville in Atteridgeville, Tshwane, say they are tired of coming face to face with dead dogs. Community leader Samuel Masilela (44) said he was shocked after coming across a man carrying a dead dog, going to dump it at the Makhaza Sports Grounds on Tuesday, 10 January. The man told him the owner paid him R5 to do so. “He refused to tell me who the owner was. I told the man to take it back to the owner and bury it.” Samuel said since last month, people have been complaining about dead dogs dumped next to their houses. “I call on residents to stop throwing their dead dogs anywhere. “They must dig holes in the bushes and bury the dogs.” Nokuthula Ngobeni (54) said on Monday when she came to sell her vegetables, she found a dead dog at the illegal dumping site. She said the problem of people dumping dead dogs has been happening since 2020. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments “These evil people are chasing away my customers. I’ve been cleaning but this is bad. People should not dump their dead dogs next to where I sell my vegetables.” She said sometimes they even dumped dead chickens and in the past, a foetus was also dumped there. Community leader Olebogeng Setsetse (55) questioned how possible it was for so many dogs to die in their area. When the SunTeam visited the area, they came across three dead dogs on different streets.
