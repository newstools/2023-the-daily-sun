THE leader of the United Africans Transformation (UAT), Abel
Tau, said he’ll continue fighting for the dignity of flood victims of Mamelodi,
Tshwane. He said he’ll ensure that they get homes and that next week,
he will inspect the land that has been earmarked for the victims and what is
causing the delay for them to occupy it. He said they were supposed to go on 16 January but heard
that they wanted to do shack marking again, which he clearly doesn’t
understand. “I will not only be dealing with Tshwane issues,but will be
working for the province and national issues. There are problems in Madibeng,
Limpopo and other provinces,” said Tau ALSO READ: Babes Wodumo's vow to Mpintsho's family He said that soon they will be drilling boreholes and
putting water tanks in Madibeng. He said there are partners who have come on board to work
with them and provide water for the community. He said that he will push the City of Tshwane to resolve the
problems. “What I expect is that the current incumbent must establish
what he had left them,” said Tau. He said the land was bought before he left. “Flood victims are grateful that I championed their cause. I
will never forget flood victims and they will be moved. I will push the city
even from outside,” said Tau. He said that his organization doesn’t want to be populist

need to look at provincial governments and local municipalities. Tau said the
new government has never created new towns and economic centres.
