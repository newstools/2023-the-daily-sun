FORMER Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Siphelele Ntshangase has admitted that it will take him a lot of hard work to get back to the level he was at in 2017 when he joined Baroka FC. Ntshangase’s career has been a rollercoaster ride. He made a name for himself at Black Leopards between 2013 and 2017. He then left Lidoda Duvha to join Baroka during the 2017-18 season. From Baroka, he was then snatched by Chiefs in 2018. He spent four years at Amakhosi, but his stay there was unsuccessful. Chiefs released him in 2021 to join Marumo Gallants, but he also struggled to break into the starting X1. His former club, Leopards who are now campaigning in the Motsepe Foundation Championship, have given him a new lease on life to resurrect his ailing career. Talking to SunSport yesterday, the 29-year-old Ntshangase said he is grateful to Leopards chairman David Thidiela for giving him a second chance. “When I first left Leopards, we parted ways on good terms. That’s why even now the chairman was able to call me and give me another chance,” said Ntshangase. “I am grateful for the opportunity and I will have to repay him with good performances that will help the club. I have not been playing for a while, but I am confident that I still have what it takes.” “With hard work, I believe I could be the same player that I was in 2013-14. I want to be even better than that because I have grown now. “I feel that there’s a reason why the chairman called me back. “The only thing that I need to do is not to put myself under pressure, just play my football. My career has had ups and downs, but everyone deserves a second chance.” Leopards have not had an easy ride in the Championship so far this season. After 12 games, they are 14th with 10 points. However, Ntshangase is optimistic that things will change for the better in the remaining 18 games of the season.
