THE R24,9 million Nulane investment trial is expected to begin in the Bloemfontein High Court, Free State on Monday, 23 January. The case concerns alleged procurement fraud relating to R24,9 million paid to Nulane Investments, a company owned by alleged Gupta associate and former Transnet board member Iqbal Sharma, between November 2011 and April 2012 by the Department of Agriculture. The money was allegedly paid to Nulane Investments for a feasibility study for the province’s flagship Mohoma Mobung project, on the basis that Nulane had unique skills to perform the work. The state alleged that Nulane Investments, however, had no employees on its books and in fact subcontracted Deloitte Ltd, to produce the report, for which Deloitte was paid R1,5 million.
