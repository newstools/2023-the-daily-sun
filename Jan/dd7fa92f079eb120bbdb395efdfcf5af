A 29-YEAR-OLD woman has moved in with her boyfriend because she fears for her life. The woman from Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun she saw one of her rapists at a local supermarket and she’s now scared of being alone. She said she thinks police are still in festive mode as they’re slow in doing their work. She was allegedly raped by three men on 16 December on her way home while coming from a groove. She requested a ride, but there were none available so she decided to walk. “I was walking past a veld when I noticed three guys were following me. “I tried to run away but I wasn’t fast enough,” she said. They dragged her to the veld and raped her while threatening her with a knife. “I can’t describe how I was feeling. I was numb. “They threatened to kill me, so I didn’t think they’d let me go after raping me,” she said.

When she recognised one of the men on New Year’s Day, she informed the police but they failed to catch him. “I was told my investigating officer wasn’t available, but someone else would be sent to assist me. I’ve been waiting till today,” she said. She said she went to live with her boyfriend because she noticed the man was acting as if he was avoiding her. “I don’t know how I’ll be able to move past this with these guys roaming around the streets. “I’m hoping that telling my story will push the police to do what they were trained to do,” she said. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo confirmed that a rape case was opened and under investigation. He promised to look into why the woman wasn’t assisted.
