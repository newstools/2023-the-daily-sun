SHE was about to prepare her son for school on Friday morning, 20 January, when she suddenly heard him scream. When Catherine Leseba rushed into the kitchen, she found her son, Tshepang, lying on the floor. The three-year-old boy had been electrocuted by a two-plate stove that was unplugged. Catherine (33) from Evaton in the Vaal said she tried to remove Tshepang from the stove but she also got electrocuted. So she screamed for help and neighbours cut off the electricity cable. “They tried to use sticks to help my son, but his body shocked them,” said Catherine. She said the entire kitchen floor shocked her, so she was forced to climb on top of her couches and jump to the door, where her neighbours caught her. Catherine said she is very hurt as she couldn’t help her son. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! “I helplessly watched my son die.
