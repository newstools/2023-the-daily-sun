A FARMER is under police guard at a Bethlehem hospital after allegedly shooting and killing his neighbour’s son. The incident happened on Sunday, 8 January after the suspect got into a fight with his neighbour over cattle that damaged his fence and crossed on to his land near Ficksburg, Free State. The trouble started when Reuter Sorour (56) was called by his neighbour, complaining about the cows. Reuter and his son, Evan Sorour (28), removed the cattle and then Evan left. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Mmako Mophiring said the suspect allegedly started assaulting Reuter, who called his son.
