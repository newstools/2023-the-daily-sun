NOT every child will pass their matric and luckily, some people understand this. A 34-year-old woman from Braamfischerville, who asked not to be named, goes to the Sasol garage every year when results come out – mainly to encourage pupils who failed not to give up. She said she had been doing this for six years, and felt better knowing that she had wiped tears off a crying child. The woman finished her matric at the age of 24 after failing a few times. And when she finally passed, she decided to motivate pupils to not give up – especially because she did not have anyone to encourage her. She revealed that her parents died when she was young, so she didn’t have an easy upbringing. Gauteng's top performer, Boitlamo Matsunyane talks to Daily Sun about his plans post matric.

She usually sits at this garage and when she notices a distressed pupil, she pulls them over to talk to them. “Sometimes talking to your parents about the challenges you’re facing during your matric year is not easy. Also, some parents expect their kids to excel without knowing how they’re even coping,” she said. Soweto Matriculants are ecstatic after receiving their results.
