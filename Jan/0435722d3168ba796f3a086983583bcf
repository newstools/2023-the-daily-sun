AN intelligence-driven operation by members of the Anti-gang Unit and Flying Squad to reduce the number of illegal guns on the streets yielded successful results in North West over the weekend. Two suspects, aged 30 and 33, were arrested for illegal possession of firearms and ammunition in the early hours of Friday morning, 27 January. According to North West police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh, police acted on information received and nabbed the two suspects in a house in Kanana near Orkney. They were found in possession of five shotguns, 9mm and R5 ammunition, blasting cartridges and shock tubes. They are expected to appear in the Orkney Magistrates Court today, 30 January.

Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Sello Kwena congratulated the team on a job well done. He pointed out that the removal of the firearms from criminals will certainly prevent the commission of serious and violent crimes and loss of innocent lives.
