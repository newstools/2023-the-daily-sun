Meanwhile, the Sizwe Kupelo Foundation, which started a petition calling for the ban of pit bulls, has condemned the brutal death. Sizwe Kupelo Foundation founder and patron, Sizwe Kupelo, said such attacks should not be happening if government would listen to the thousands who signed the petition and ban these wild animals living among people. “Although it won’t bring back their loved ones, we encourage families of the victims and survivors of pit bull attacks to file civil lawsuits against dog owners,” he said. Kupelo urged the government to heed the call after almost 138 000 people signed their petition. He said the petition was handed over to the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development Minister Thoko Didiza’s office last month.
