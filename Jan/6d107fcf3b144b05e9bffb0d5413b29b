IT has been the worst performing school in the Gauteng West district for the past four years, with a 2021 dismal 41,5% matric pass rate. Then the Gauteng Department of Education brought in a new principal to improve it, and he turned things around. This resulted in an improved matric pass rate, motivated teachers and pupils. Kgothalang Secondary School in Bekkersdal achieved an 87,3% matric pass rate in 2022, making it one of the best performing schools in the district. It achieved 44 bachelor passes, 44 diplomas and 22 higher certificates with 16 matrics not making it and four incomplete results. This warranted the school to receive a special message of appreciation from the Education MEC Matome Chiloane for a job well done last Friday. Caretaker principal Barnard Rampaku said the school received an award for this improvement, which he showed to Daily Sun.

Rampaku said this was the start, and had encouraged them to work even harder. Proud parents said they were happy with the turn-around the new principal had made. “Our children are more motivated and we hope this year’s matriculants will maintain the standard or go higher than this,” said proud parent Lillian Mvelase.
