A LOCAL company is in hot water with the Hawks after defrauding the Lesotho government through alleged tender corruption. The Hawks’ priority crime specialised investigation unit, together with the National Prosecution Authority’s asset forfeiture unit, have successfully secured a preservation order of more than R3 million against Maru-a-Pula Construction for fraud. According to Hawks spokesman Captain Christopher Singo, it was reported that in 2021, Lesotho experienced floods, leading to roads being damaged. Singo said the government then established a ministerial committee, including the departments of Public Works and Local Government, to assess the extent of damage. “Lesotho disaster management authority was then mandated to coordinate the process by procuring and paying services rendered by the contractors for fixing of the roads. It is alleged that certain tenders were issued without following proper procurement procedures,” he said.
