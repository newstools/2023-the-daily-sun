PEOPLE often call him Nathi Mankayi, said musician Nhlonipho Dlamini (30). “People think we look alike and we are both in the music industry,” he said. “Sometimes people ask if they can take selfies with me!” Nhlonipho, who lives in Joburg, said even at gigs people are shocked when he performs, thinking he’s Nathi. “We may have some features that make us look alike, but we are different,” he said. The Afro pop, Afro soul and amapiano star said he knows Nathi and he doesn’t mind being his lookalike. “Sometimes I feel bad because I want people to see me for me rather than being likened to somebody else,” he said.  He said he collaborated with Oskido on an EP titled Nhlonipho and Oskido. He also featured Robot Boii on a single, Thandanani. He also worked with Tanzanian artist Damian Soul last year. Nhlonipho is in studio working on a love song, which he hopes to surprise his fans with. Register and SIGN IN to read comments
