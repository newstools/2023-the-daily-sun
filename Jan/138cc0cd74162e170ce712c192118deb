GRADE 12 pupils from Taung, North West, who go to Kebinelang High School in Manthe village, do not feel safe anymore. This after a fellow pupil was allegedly raped on 19 January while walking home after extra classes. According to Warrant Officer Tryphosa van Rooyen, the pupil (20) was walking home with her friend. “The girls were walking home from Manthe after school when they were stopped by an unknown man. He threatened them with a knife and allegedly forced himself on the victim. The suspect lost control of his knife, and the victim and friend managed to run away.” An eyewitness, who is also in grade 12, said she did not feel safe anymore. “We normally use scholar transport but on the day, we were attending extra classes. So, the transport left on its scheduled time. We were walking behind the victim and her friend when the incident happened. The guy was wearing a red overall top, brown trousers and red neck warmer,” she said. She urged the Department of Education to organise scholar transport that could ferry them home after extra classes.

Community Safety and Transport spokesman Alpheus Koonyaditse said MEC Sello Lehari condemned the incident however: “The service provider and the school agree on a time for the transportation for pupils.” One of the parents said it was disheartening to see this happening while pupils were trying to obtain education. “The department should understand that pupils are not safe as they walk home alone. Violence and criminality continue to affect us all but as a society, we need to work together and combat it,” she said. The investigation is ongoing and police have urged anyone with information to contact CrimeStop on 0800 10111.
