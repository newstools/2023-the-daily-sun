KWAITO star L’vovo Derango has detailed the reasons he suffered a stroke. L’vovo, whose real name is Thokozani Ndlovu (40) from Newcastle in the middle of KZN, suffered a stroke last month. This triggered rumours which went viral on social media that he was dead which was immediately dismissed by his record company Derrango Records and Entertainment. Speaking about his stroke which landed him in hospital, he said that it was caused by not taking his treatment well as well as eating unhealthy food. He said after he was involved in a car accident in May last year, which put him in a coma, the doctors gave him the treatment for his injuries.

I was taking it but not according to the doctors’ instructions. This is because I felt well not knowing that I wasn’t fully recovered. I was also instructed to eat healthy which I didn’t do. I ate junk food and not so healthy food. That’s why I suffered a stroke,” said L’vovo. He said that his left side of his body was badly damaged. “My eye and mouth were affected but I feel much better. I was discharged from hospital last week and I’m currently recovering from home. But I do go to the doctor for a check-up,” said L’vovo. The kwaito legend advised everyone who is on treatment to follow their doctors’ instructions.
