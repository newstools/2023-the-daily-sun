FACEBOOK users have expressed their disappointment with Mzansi celebrities. They are complaining that celebrities are taking advantage of them. They said most of them use Facebook to build profiles but once they are well-established, they dump the platform and move on others. This online discussion was opened by TV host Luyanda Potwana on his page. He wrote: “Why do most of these celebrities and people who think they’ve made it in life undermine Facebook so much? There’s just this ‘I’m too fabulous for Facebook’ attitude they have. Kanti what’s wrong with Facebook?” ALSO READ : Why Makhadzi and Master KG broke up! His followers could not agree more, as they started taking turns to respond. Samkelo Tempi commented: “South African celebrities live in their own world. Once they make it in life, they forget about ordinary South Africans. They hardly comment on national issues. For example, they never commented on that gas truck incident that killed people in Boksburg. They were also quiet about the Nyobeni stampede where teenagers were killed. They should learn from American celebrities who always get involved in national issues.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments Sehlabaka wrote: “It is very confusing because when things go south for them, they start asking for donations on Facebook. They forget that Facebook has more users than other platforms.”
