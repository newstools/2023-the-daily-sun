MAMELODI Sundowns have sucessfully completed a rare double over Kaizer Chiefs in the DStv Premiership. Sundowns continued with their scintilating form when they defeated Chiefs 1-0 at FNB Stadium on Saturday night. The victory which was the 12 consecutive win means they have now opened a 17 points gab between them and second placed Richards Bay FC. Sundowns have now collected a tally of 46 points from 18 league matches this season and at this rate it looks like they are on their way to clinch a historic sixth title in a row. On the Chiefs side, the defeat piles more pressure on underfoire coach Arthur Zwane who has only won seven games out of 17 league outings that have been played this season. Neo Maema scored the only goal of the match in the 20th minute of the game to hand Chiefs their third successive defeat. Chiefs started the year with a shocking 1-0 defeat against Sekhukhune United on the club birthday. That result was followed by a 4-0 hammering by AmaZulu last Friday. Amakhosi remain in position five with 24 points from 17 games. On Tuesday Sundowns will travel to Mpumalanga to face TS Galaxy while Chiefs will get a week to prepare their next Sunday match against Royal AM at the same venue
