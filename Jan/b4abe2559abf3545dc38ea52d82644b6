THE City of Cape Town has been battling with sewage spills since 2022. The situation recently worsened with the municipality being forced to temporarily shut down two beaches on New Year’s Day and 2 January due to kak flowing into the water. On Monday, the city closed Fish Hoek Beach due to a sewage overflow, a day after Small Beach and Strand Beach were closed due to similar issues. The municipality blamed the issue at Fish Hoek on illegal dumping. Meanwhile, a statement released by the eThekwini Municipality left many angry.  On Wednesday, the municipality took to Facebook to wish the City of Cape Town a “speedy recovery”. DA caucus leader in eThekwini Thabani Mthethwa said the party rejected the statement, which it labelled as childish. “The DA believes that the ANC should focus its energy on fixing infrastructure instead of issuing frivolous and petty statements about other municipalities,” he said. The statement by eThekwini councillor Nkosenhle Madlala was met by backlash on social media, with many labelling it a poor attempt at humour. Msawakhe Mayisela, spokesman for the eThekwini Municipality, said the city stood by its statement.
