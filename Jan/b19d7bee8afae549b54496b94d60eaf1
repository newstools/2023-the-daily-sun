KZN Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza says she’S dismayed by the murder of Philasande Shange (7). Khoza has strongly condemned the gruesome murder of the little boy, who went missing on Thursday, 5 January. His family found his head and leg on Sunday after an anonymous SMS notification. The body parts were found about 15 minutes away from home in Ntshawini near KwaDukuza. The family was told via SMS that other body parts would be sold in Mozambique. Khoza described the murder as barbaric, stating that criminals must be brought to book.  “An innocent child’s life was cut short by heartless criminals who need to be traced and prosecuted. As a society, we cannot continue to live like this,” she said. She pleaded with residents to continue supporting the family and share information that could lead to the suspects’ arrest. “The gruesome murder of a child is an indication that we have a lot of wickedness in society. We need to work together to ensure the protection of children. We can only pray that the criminals can direct the family to the remains of the body,” said Khoza, who further conveyed condolences to the family. “I have deployed a team of social workers to the family to provide psychosocial support,” she added.
