THABO Jiyane (33) said he will never steal again. He said he used to specialise in stealing wheelbarrows to provide for his wife. Now he said he stopped that in 2021 after he was caught by the residents of Amanda Park and Marry Me informal settlements in Tshwane who moered him, but spared his life. He now protects his community from thugs who steal and terrorise the community.  Thabo told Daily Sun that in the end the rewards for stealing is death. He said he’s grateful that his life was spared. “I want to tell people that stealing doesn’t pay as that angers the community and they will hurt you badly, and sometimes even kill you,” he said. Thabo is pleading with the thugs who terrorise his community to stop their evil acts. He said that at the moment he’s doing odd jobs.
