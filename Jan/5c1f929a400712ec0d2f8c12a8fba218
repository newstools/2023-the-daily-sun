A MEMORIAL precinct for the victims of the Sebokeng Massacre was unveiled on Thursday, 12 January. The memorial in zone 7 of Sebokeng, the Vaal, was erected by the Vaal 21 Foundation on the anniversary of the killing of 45 people at a night vigil for ANC Youth League member Christopher Nangalembe in 1991. Members of the community and municipal officials gathered at Evaton Cemetery and the newly-built memorial precinct. A wreath-laying ceremony was held at the cemetery at around 8am before the event proceeded to the precinct. Tankiso Mohlamme (49), one of the survivors, said although it had been 32 years, he had not forgotten the events of that night. He thanked the Vaal 21 Foundation for building the precinct, saying the government had forgotten about the massacre.
