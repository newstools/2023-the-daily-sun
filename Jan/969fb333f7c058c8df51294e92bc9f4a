THAPELO Amad is expected to be sworn in as Joburg new mayor on Monday, 30 January. The Al Jama-ah leader, a minority party that holds three of the 270 seats in the council, was elected on Friday, beating DA’s Mpho Phalatse, who was ousted in a vote of no-confidence on Thursday. Phalatse put her name in the hat in Friday’s vote with the hope of being re-elected. Amad’s election was supported by the ANC, which holds the most seats in the council and the EFF. With Amad as the first citizen of the city, it means the top two positions in the council are now held by minority parties as the speaker, Colleen Makhubele, is from the tiny Cope.

Our priorities are to ensure our residents have access to clean water, have proper roads and feel safe,” Amad said.
