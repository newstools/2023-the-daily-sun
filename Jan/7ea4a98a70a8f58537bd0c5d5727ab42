PRESIDENT Cyril Ramaphosa has joined public members in congratulating all matriculants. He described those who passed grade 12 as a beacon for a hopeful future. Ramaphosa further said pupils managed to give an outstanding and collective performance in the face of challenges from two years of the Covid-19 pandemic. “The class of 2022 deserves the congratulations and respect of the nation for rising above the challenges of Covid-19, load shedding and a period of unrest,” he said. “We must all work together to build a society where pupils are not measured only by their resilience in testing times, but can also fulfil their potential in conducive conditions.” Ramaphosa added that the class of 2022 had, through its commendable performance, made the future more hopeful – in which this generation of young South Africans would take the country to new heights.  “As much as we celebrate individual achievement, the class of 2022 also constitutes a pass for our education system. It vindicates the extensive and unwavering investment we have made in education during nearly 30 years of freedom,” he said. “We owe their achievements of 2022 to the diligence of pupils alongside the commitment and support of teachers, who also endured challenges, as well as education officials,” he added. For those who did not make it this time around, he said this was not the end of the road, and encouraged them to pick themselves up and take advantage of options that would empower them to continue their journey to success.
