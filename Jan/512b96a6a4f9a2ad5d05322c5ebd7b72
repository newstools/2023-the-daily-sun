RESIDENTS in Eldorado Park are continuing to occupy land illegally despite warnings from the municipality and the Joburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD). They told Daily Sun they won’t stop and as long as they don’t get houses or stands, they’ll keep erecting shacks at any open field. Ward 17 Councillor Bishop Robertson said it breaks his heart as a leader to see residents spending their hard-earned money to buy land illegally, which they are going to lose without recourse. “No one is allowed to allocate or sell land to residents unless they are an official designated to do so. “I’m calling on all leaders to join the fight against land grabs,” said Robertson. He said he will seek assistance from the City of Joburg to contain the situation by sending JMPD officers to remove those who have illegally occupied land in the ward. Daily Sun spoke to residents who said they applied for RDPs a long time ago, but haven’t received any response from human settlements department. They said that’s why they were buying and occupy land illegally.

Life is becoming more expensive and we just need to have our own homes and things will be better,” said resident Prudence Ndlovu (46). Another resident said her brother is kicking her out of their family home and she has nowhere else to go. Daily Sun reached out to the City of Joburg, but they hadn’t responded at the time of going to print.
