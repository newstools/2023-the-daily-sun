THANDO Skwatsha believes that one’s authenticity is what makes them special. The Cape Town-born singer, dancer and actor is a true African ambassador.  On this week’s instalment of Famous Friday, we sat down with him to talk about 2022 and what this new year had in store for him. “Thando is a multitalented artist who not only believes in the reinvention of oneself, but also in doing the reinvention through performing arts in the South African context.” ALSO READ | Perfectly imperfect women shine on Miss Universe stage He shared on the creative process of putting together his debut album, Iimini Nentsuku, released last year. “Iimini Nentsuku was something that shockingly came easy. I had never written in my home language before, but I was always worried about the musical outcome. “But writing in my home language was essentially mic to pen than pen to mic.” And some of the singles from the album include Ngiyazifela and Isaziso. Thando said Isaziso was where his cultural lineage was introduced. “The title of the song, which means announcement, was my musical and ancestral announcement.” Thando, who loves cooking, told Daily Sun he would love to do his own rendition of Hurt Me So Good by Jazmine Sullivan. And if he were to play a character on a film, it would be a crazy character like Madea, played by Tyler Perry. He said the one dance move that best described him was the pouncing cat.
