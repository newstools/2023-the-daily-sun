AFTER last week’s sad turn of events on Uthando Nesthembu, Thobile “MaKhumalo” Mseleku’s feelings were hurt. On the episode of the family’s reality TV show, she said: “I am very disappointed that the one person I always show up for cannot do the same for me. I thought MaCele would support me like I usually support her whenever she hosts an event. Even if it’s her relative’s event, I show up because I am supporting her, but she cannot do the same for me. As for MaYeni, I am not shocked that she said she would not make it because usually when I have an event or a ceremony at my house she never comes. She has shown me from day one that she just tolerates me.” ALSO READ : Get your entries ready – SAMAs loading... However, this week’s episode, which closed off the season, picked up on a more cheerful note as her family prepared to host umembeso. MaKhumalo said she was happy and grateful to the friends and family members who took the time to attend her ceremony. She took to social media to express her gratitude. She wrote: “To the Mseleku family led by uMaNgwabe, thank you for lending a helping hand, your calls and messages checking if the arrangements were coming together perfectly, I don’t take it for granted.
