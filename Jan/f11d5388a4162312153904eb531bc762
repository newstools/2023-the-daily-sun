MOJALEFA Mokhuma left for initiation school in Free State before Christmas, and his family has not seen him since. According to his mum Linah (48), friends of the 26-year-old from Meyerton, Vaal, visited her a week before Christmas and said he sent his greetings to his sister. “He was a teacher at the initiation school and supposed to come home with the boys on 7 January, but he is nowhere to be found.” Linah said a man told her that Mojalefa was beaten up by a group of women from a girls’ initiation school. They allegedly accused him of being sent by a sangoma to bring bad spirits. “The man said they beat him up with a sjambok and burnt him with plastic and cow dung,” she said.  The man told the SunTeam he saw Mojalefa being beaten, with his hands and feet tied. He said a group of women and men beat him from 10am until midnight and when he begged them to call an ambulance or cops, they threatened to beat him up too.  They allegedly then threw him onto their fireplace and he left. When he returned, there was a big fire burning and when he asked where Mojalefa was, they chased him away.
