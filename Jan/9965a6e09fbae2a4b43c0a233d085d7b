  JUDGEMENT
in the private prosecution of President Cyril Ramaphosa by former president
Jacob Zuma will this morning Monday, January 16 be delivered. This comes
amid reports that the president has cancelled his trip to the annual investment
gathering in Davos, Switzerland. Ramaphosa
last week launched an urgent bid to have a private prosecution by Zuma to be
dismissed, arguing that his appearance will lead to him suffering irreparable
damage. The
president has also argued that the prosecution by his predecessor was unlawful
and the certificate to privately prosecute him did not allow for it. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments  However,
Zuma's lawyers have argued that the private certificate does cover him and
Ramaphosa should argue his case in the criminal case court and not in the civil
matter. Ramaphosa
has been summoned to appear in the criminal matter this Thursday and Zuma's
lawyers have argued that his urgent application was an attempt to avoid being
in the dock.
