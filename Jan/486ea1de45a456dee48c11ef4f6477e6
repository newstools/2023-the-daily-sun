MISSING persons cases are being reported to the Limpopo police almost daily. More than 20 people have been reported missing since last month, with only a few of them being found. The latest case is that of Mokgatla Kgaladi (14) from Dennilton, who went missing on Sunday, 8 January. She allegedly left home at about 1pm to go to a nearby shop to buy chips, but never came back. And, no one remembers the clothes she was wearing at the time. The matter was reported to the cops on Monday, and they launched a search operation.  Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Thembi Hadebe has urged residents to be vigilant and aware of the whereabouts of their family members at all times, especially kids. “People found being careless around their children will be arrested and charged with child neglect,” she said. Hadebe also advised parents not to send their children to schools in other provinces to prevent such incidents. She further issued a stern warning to people who continued to report false cases.

She also urged residents to inform loved ones if they would be staying with friends or relatives as failure to do so could cause panic, resulting in a person being reported missing.
