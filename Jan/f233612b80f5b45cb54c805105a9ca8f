PHANUEL Maemu is on the verge of quitting his farming business after six years because of load shedding. The 32-year-old from Masea Village outside Thohoyandou, Limpopo, cannot pump water from his borehole for his plants. He told Daily Sun that to water his vegetables properly, he needed 24 hours of uninterrupted power supply. He recently planted cabbage, tomatoes and green peppers but they died. “I lost over R500 000 in profit. I couldn’t send any of my produce to the market or sell to villagers as the cabbages died while the tomatoes and green peppers became rotten,” he said.

He said he had two boreholes but one stopped working due to load shedding.  “The little profit I make goes towards fixing equipment damaged by the power going on and off. I can’t even take my produce to the markets because I don’t have money for petrol.” He said he had to clear his farm and was preparing to plant okra. “I hope the plants survive because I won’t be able to recover the money I have already lost.” Phanuel said he was hoping for the situation to improve as he plans to plant cabbages and tomatoes again in April. “If things don’t get better, I don’t know what I will do. It might be the end of my farm.” For his farm to survive, he needed back-up power, solar panels and water storage facilities. Derrick Makhubela, chairman of local non-governmental organisation Itlhokomele Moafrika, said when the farm struggled, so did the community. “He used to donate vegetables to the poor, but he now can’t.”
