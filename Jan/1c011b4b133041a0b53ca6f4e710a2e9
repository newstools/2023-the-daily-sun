ANC National Executive Committee member Dr Violet Siwela has strongly condemned the brutal killing of Tswelopele Funerals driver Albert Mnisi (54). She was speaking during his funeral attended by hundreds of mourners. The driver was killed when he and his colleague were shot by thugs as they approached a stop in Alexandria Trust, Marite near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, on 10 January. The funeral was held on Sunday, 15 January in Xanthia near Bushbuckridge. Siwela also expressed her condolences to the Mnisi family.  Mnisi’s brother Mandla Mnisi said they can’t find closure. “Our brother was killed for R9 000 by three young criminals on the loose. They also shot and wounded his colleague who’s still fighting for his life in hospital. We believe our law enforcement’s arm is very long and will find his killers to face the mighty hand of the law,” he said. Brother Aubrey Mnisi, who is also the acting director of community services in the Bushbuckridge Local Municipality, said Albert was a real man who loved his family and deserved a good send-off. Tswelopele Funerals CEO Eugene Gouws, who described his company as a family, said: “I think when he woke up in the morning he said to himself that he’s going to make a difference in the world. As the father of this family, I am saddened by this death.” You must be SIGNED IN  to read comments Colonel Donald Mdhluli confirmed the police were investigating a case of murder. “No one has been arrested as yet,” he said.
