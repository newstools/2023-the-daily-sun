RESIDENTS from Masiphumelele in Fishhoek are shocked after a man threw himself in fire and died. The residents said Qondile Njalisa (39), the owner of a shack where a fire started, committed suicide on New Year’s eve by jumping into flames. Two people were killed in the fire and 36 homes were destroyed. The fire allegedly started when Qondile left a candle burning and went to a friend’s house. This led to a gas tank explosion which set shacks and an RDP house on fire. Phozisa Mthombeni (50), a family member who lived in the same yard as the dead, said Qondile told her it was better for him to die than to face the wrath of his sister as the fire had destroyed her house. He then ran and jumped into the fire.  “It is unbelievable,” said Phozisa. “It happened very fast. You can’t kill yourself out of fear of being shouted at.” Another family member, Nokulunga Sam (32), said the fire was a mistake and people make mistakes. “He should not have been so hard on himself,” said Nokulunga. The residents said they were sad that two other people died while trying to get out of the fire. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Joseph Swartbooi said when Ocean View police arrived at Masibulele Street in Masipumelele at about 1.30am, they found shacks on fire and requested the services of fire and rescue who extinguished the blaze.
