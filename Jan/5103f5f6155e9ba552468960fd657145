DESPITE many Life Esidimeni mental patients’ deaths as a result of hunger, dehydration, and negligence, Dr Makgabo Manamela said it was the NGOs’ responsibility to make an effort when experiencing shortages of food, medication and clothing. Manamela, who is the former director of the Mental Health Directorate at the Gauteng Department of Health, said plans were already made by the department for NGOs to outsource basic needs should they experience shortages while waiting for funding – and affected NGOs had to approach those facilities. Manamela was giving evidence before the Life Esidimeni Inquest held at the North Gauteng High Court, in a virtual sitting on Monday, 30 January.  Section27 Advocate Adila Hassim, representing affected families, asked Manamela if she aware that shortages of food, medication and clothing would have adverse effects on the level of care of patients. Manamela said two companies “Masana Dieticians” was outsourced to provide food and “Smith” to provide clothes to patients placed in NGOs, and further arrangements were made with Weskoppies Psychiatrist Hospital to supply them with medication.

Some NGOs did ask for food and clothes.” Tshepong Centre is among NGOs that spent months without funding from the department. The centre said the staff failed to report for duty because they were not getting paid. The inquest is resuming on Tuesday morning, 31 January.
