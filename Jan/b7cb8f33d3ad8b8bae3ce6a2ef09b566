BRADLEY Grobler’s late goal helped SuperSport United beat Cape Town City 1-0 in a DStv Premiership match at DHL Stadium on Tuesday. Their victory has escalated them to second place on the Premiership table with 27 points in 14 games while the Citizens still can’t escape the relegation threat with 16 points, five points ahead of bottom side Maritzburg United. Both teams came into this game brimming with confidence as they resumed their DStv Premiership campaign by securing three points after the World Cup break. City beat Royal AM 2-1 at home while Matsatsantsa A Pitori registered a hard fought 1-0 win over Marumo Gallants. SuperSport United coach Gavin Hunt and his charges travelled to Cape Town at the back of a five-game unbeaten run after securing four wins and one draw. On the other hand, Eric Tinkler and his Citizens have been inconsistent having secured two wins, two losses, and one draw. Tinkler reinforced his squad with two foreigners,  Cameroonian Bertrand Mano who scored on debut against Royal AM and Colombian Juan Zapata who made his debut today. However, it was all in vain as they were dominated in their own backyard by the visiting Tshwane side. The game remained goalless up until Hunt pushed his charges to continue applying pressure and they finally got rewarded through the veteran Grobler just eight minutes before full-time. Having kept a second clean sheet in a row, United stand a chance of maintaining their unbeaten run when they face Golden Arrows, rivals Mamelodi Sundowns, and Richards Bay in their next three fixtures. On the other hand, Tinkler will need to plug gaps in his leaky defence and also work on finishing to convert  chances they create. The Cirtizens will face Orlando Pirates, Chippa United, and TS Galaxy in a bid to ease their relegation troubles.
