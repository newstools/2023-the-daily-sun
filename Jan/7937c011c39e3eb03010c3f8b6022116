THE National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said load shedding could be avoided if the Kendal, Matla and Tutuka power stations were operating at full capacity. The union said it was greatly concerned about the continuation of stage six load shedding by Eskom when there was a solution. Thapelo Malekutu, deputy regional secretary for the Highveld in Mpumalanga, said ongoing load shedding could increase unemployment and poverty. “The NUM feels that we could have avoided much of this debilitating load shedding if the government had moved with greater speed to implement the commitments of the Eskom Social Compact,” he said. “As the NUM, we are concerned that there doesn’t seem to be a willingness to resolve the load shedding that is engulfing the entire country.” He said when the union engaged with members on the ground, they said load shedding would continue because certain power stations were operating at half capacity. “The challenges at these power stations are known. “It is disturbing that the general manager of Tutuka is a failure and yet, he is still in that position,” said Malekutu. He said the manager was more concerned with having bodyguards than turning the station around and called for his immediate removal. Malekutu said the union was also not happy with the management at the other stations. “The issues of replacements, breakdowns and maintenance spares have been a continuing problem and must be attended to,” he said. Malekutu called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to consider engaging with the union and stop considering reports from Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan.

He misled the president on a number of occasions and brought the so-called retired engineers into the system,” he said. “Eskom does not need old engineers but requires young and energetic engineers.”
