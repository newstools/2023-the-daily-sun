MANY physiotherapists open their businesses at malls or in the suburbs. But physiotherapist Palesa Conco chose to open hers ekasi, after she noticed that a lot of people who needed her services couldn’t afford to pay for expensive therapists. She opened Physio 360 in Daveyton, Ekurhuleni three years ago, to enable her patients to reach her services. Most of her patients suffer from strokes, diabetes and other forms of disabilities. She massages and trains those who are unable to walk so they can do tasks by themselves. “I’m happy to see many of my patients making improvements and can do things by themselves,” said Palesa. Palesa recently invited all her patients to celebrate International Day of Disabled Persons, which is commemorated on 3 December. Former principal Joseph Nhleko was shot during a hijacking in 2008. He sustained spine injuries and has since been wheelchair-bound. He said going to therapy with Palesa has helped him a lot as he’s able to do things by himself. He has even written a book about the political upheavals in Mzansi and Lesotho. “It’s my wish to have the book prescribed at high schools,” said Joseph. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments
