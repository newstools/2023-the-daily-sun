A YOUNG woman (20) is very angry. She said she was helping her younger brother (12) at school when a teacher insulted her, calling her names and threatening to beat her up. The woman from Boekenhouthoek near Kwaggafontein in Mpumalanga said she went to Khayalethu Primary School on Tuesday, 10 January to enquire about her younger brother’s books. There were only seven exercise books inside the pack and there were no pencils or pens. “I wanted to know why the pack was different from the one his classmates got,” she said. “The male teacher I spoke to said it’s not their problem and they don’t work with books and he left.” ALSO READ: Matriculant sangoma: Ancestor guided me Then she spoke to another male teacher who became very angry. “I insisted that I want to know the reason and he threatened to beat me up. I became emotional and we had an altercation. He then insulted me by calling me by my private parts,” she said. “Another teacher came to intervene. On Wednesday (11 January), I went back to the school with my mother. We met the deputy principal and we explained to him what had happened,” she said. “The deputy principal explained that the problem is with the department. He told us that we need to buy additional books.” She said she felt very embarrassed and she regards this kind of treatment as gender-based violence. “I became very angry and I also retaliated. All this happened in full view of other parents. I was harassed,” she said. Mpumalanga Department of Education spokesman Jasper Zwane said they will send officials to investigate the alleged conduct of the said teacher at the school.
