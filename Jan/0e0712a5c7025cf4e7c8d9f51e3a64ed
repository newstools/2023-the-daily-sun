POLICE in Cape Town have arrested a woman with contraband that she was intending to smuggle into Voorbrug Prison. Her parcel included cellphones, drugs and SIM cards. The Western Cape extortion task team cops responded to a tip-off of a consignment destined for the prison. “The members searched the premises on Bevan Street in Greenhaven, Manenberg, and seized 385 Mandrax tablets, 10kg of dagga, 5g of cocaine, 10 cellphones with batteries and 35 SIM cards. The contraband would have been smuggled into Voorbrug. A woman (58) was arrested on charges of dealing in drugs,” said Captain Frederick van Wyk.
