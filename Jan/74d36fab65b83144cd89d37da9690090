JOBURG squatters plan to erect their mkhukhus again even if the Joburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) comes and removes them. They told Daily Sun that they’ve been suffering for too long and no one is helping them. Therefore, they will do whatever it takes to have a roof over their heads, whether people like it or not.

Other Joburg residents believe that these mkhukhus will cause them more problems. “Joburg is already a mess with all the criminal activities happening in this place, but now this will make things worse and we won’t tolerate it,” said Siyamthanda Ngcobo (46). Another concerned resident said she was mugged two weeks ago passing near those mkhukhus and people just watched like it was a show. “These people are obviously about themselves and nothing else,” said Ntombikayise Dlamini (29).

One man who asked not to be named said he’s been homeless for three years, living under a bridge. And now that he has his little home, he won’t let anyone take it away from him. Another resident of the new squatter camp said as long as the government keeps dragging its feet on RDPs, then they’ll put their mkhukhus anywhere they want.
