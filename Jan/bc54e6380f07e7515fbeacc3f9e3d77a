Council of Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) spokeswoman,
Keshvi Nair said the safety of people and the community was prioritised and it
was decided that Sheba would be shot and killed instead of darted due to the
risk. When asked what
would happen to the owner of the tiger, Nair said: “The case is still under
investigation and a decision will be made once all factors have been taken into
account.” “Despite
the fact that both the NSPCA and the local SPCA were involved in this from the
start in the early hours of Sunday morning, neither the NSPCA nor the local
SPCA was contacted when Sheba was sighted, shot and killed on Wednesday morning,”
Nair added.  You must be SIGNED IN to read comments
