SHE has always had a love for books, storytelling and writing plays. So Pastor Joy has written her first book, titled Undistracted. Pastor Joy, whose real name is Mihloti Mogale, shares her life experiences in the book. The 50-year-old from Meadowlands, Soweto, said in 2006, her senior pastor asked her to preach and she spoke about “how to serve the Lord without distraction as a single person”. “I basically illustrated that it was okay to be single and still serve the Lord. “I emphasised that singleness also meant to be one with the Lord. “In 2017, I started writing the book and finished it in 2022 after a lot of motivation. “It’s indeed an exciting journey,” she said. Pastor Joy said the book is about how she was blinded by the wrong choices she made. “My life was headed downhill until God made Himself known. “I had to overcome rejection, tribalism and discrimination, and learnt to hope for a better tomorrow,” she said. “I like to use the analogy of a camera lens. “Whenever people take pictures, they zoom until the object comes into focus. “Anything that is not of interest is left out. So it is a distraction. “It is important to take stock of what steals our focus, attention, time, money and energy,” she said. Pastor Joy launched her book last year September at Grace Kingdom Community Centre, where 120 copies were sold. She said the book is inspirational and people need to buy it, especially women. “It’s a book that will instil hope in the life of someone who identifies with what I learnt to overcome as a young woman looking for love in the wrong places, my challenges in the corporate sector, and how the Lord revealed Himself to me.” She said many readers are happy with the book. “The feedback is good, and . I rate it 8/10 and readers are already waiting for a second book,” she said.
