MEMBERS of the EFF have closed a pub that has been accused of racism. A group of the party’s supporters, led by regional secretary, Banzi Dambuza, gathered outside the Hank’s Olde Irish Tavern in Cape Town on Tuesday, 6 December. This was in response to the viral video of a man, arguing with the owners of the club. In the video, the white man is furious at the owner of the bar, saying his black friend was barred from entering unless he was with a white person. The tavern left a note from its lawyer, William Booth, stating that the owner and staff were intimidated and threatened, so they were closed. The letter said they were aware of the planned protest. “The venue, owners and staff have received direct threats of intimidation, violence, damage to persons and property by individuals who have stated in the media that they will be participating in the said protest,” the note reads.  “We, as owners, have never instructed our staff to discriminate on any basis whatsoever, whether gender, sexual orientation or race.” The EFF gathered at the entrance of the building around 5pm, which is its opening time. They sang and danced with placards condemning racism. “They are closed today and have left a note by the door, but we’re saying as the EFF, we’re not done with them,” said Dambuza. You must be
