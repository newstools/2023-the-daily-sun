SANGOMA Mable Mhlanga’s life has become a misery. Mable (42) said bad luck has haunted her since 2020 when she met her mlungu boyfriend Tiaan Vos, who is 22 years old. The sangoma said it could be that her ancestors don’t like her boyfriend but that has never been communicated to her. “I have ended up begging from the people as I’m not making money anymore,” she said. “But I love him and I don’t plan to part ways with him any time soon.” She said clients are not coming to her that much and those who come are struggling to pay. “I love people and sometimes I end up healing them for free. I always help people but now I’m a beggar,” she said. The mother of six said they are surviving on the grant of three of her children. Mable said she even performed ancestral rituals last year to please her ancestors but still clients are not coming.  She said her ancestors had asked her to perform rituals and sacrifice a cow but without money that would be difficult. “I don’t think my ancestors are angry, but I suspect people are jealous of my relationship because my ancestors would have told me not to date him. But I’m not sure anymore if he could be the problem. We are happily in love with my mlungu man but neither of us has money,” said Mable. She said the mlungu told her he loved her very much and vowed he will take care of her and her family. “I am appealing to other sangomas and even other people to help me,” she said. Mable said she will not dump her mlungu because of the sufferings and would rather die with him.
