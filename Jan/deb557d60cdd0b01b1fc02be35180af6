JAKUB Dzuirkiewicz is learning about conservation by cycling from Egypt to Cape Town. The second-year environmental studies student at the University of Technology in Poland arrived in Mahikeng, North West, on Tuesday, 3 January after entering South Africa through the border with Botswana. He said when he left Egypt on 9 October, he expected to arrive in Cape Town within nine days. “Africa is a vast continent where different cultures co-exist. I have met amazing people throughout my journey, although I had some challenges and came across hostile situations, especially in North African countries. The aim of this initiative was to learn and gather as much knowledge as I could about Africa and its people,” he said. Jakub said the sunsets and sunrises in Africa were some of the most beautiful in the world.

Local social activist Thato Molosankwe, who attempted to make the same trip across Africa but had to abort in Zambia, said he was excited when Total Garage employees in Mahikeng told him about Jakub. “As someone with first-hand experience of what he’s doing, I tried to call some government leaders to give him financial support but unfortunately, they couldn’t come through,” he said. However, Molosankwe said he managed to organise accommodation for Jakub.  The Moshawane Cycling Club also came out to support him. Head coach Phumzile Bekwape said: “It’s inspiring to see someone from as a far away as Poland embarking on this initiative.”
