Mokau Kujoane (29) has been on the run since November but allegedly kept on phoning the 11-year-old’s mum, threatening to kill her too. The SunTeam has seen threatening messages sent to the mum, Seipati. The suspect was arrested for shoplifting in Pietermaritzburg, KZN, on 21 December. Teboho was kidnapped on 26 November and his body later found dumped near his home in Baghdad Village outside Phuthaditjhaba, Free State.

I’m worried about the element of secrecy,” she said. “I was not even aware that he had appeared in court. The accused had no mercy for my innocent son. His body was covered in stab wounds,” she said. Masetjhaba Lakaje-Mosia, ANC Women’s League chairwoman in the Thabo Mofutsanyana District Municipality, said the accused did not deserve bail.  “He deserves to be punished. “We are going to march to court to demand he not be given bail.” Kujoane appeared in the Makwane Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 3 January, on charges of murder, attempted murder and assault.
