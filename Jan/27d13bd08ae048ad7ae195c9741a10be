The South African Depression and Anxiety Group (Sadag) has advised pupils who feel anxious and overwhelmed to call in for counselling. Last year, a total of 753 964 full-time and 167 915 registered for 2022 matric exams. The exams were written in 6 307 centres and they were not without hiccups. Some pupils at Phandimfundo High School in Etwatwa, Ekurhuleni, failed to write an economics paper after their principal allegedly told them not to report to school because of a service delivery protest. They had to write the paper on a later date on 7 December.  Cheating was also rife in 2022 matric exams. About 1 189 grade 12 pupils were allegedly involved in cheating.
