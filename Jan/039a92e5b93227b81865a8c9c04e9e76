AS A prophet, he prays for people and heals them but he didn’t see it coming when thugs stole from him. The prophet’s shack was broken into and his clothes and a bag were stolen. Apostolic Church prophet Oscar Chauke (30) from Amanda Park, Tshwane, said thugs broke into his shack on 1 January while he was working night shift as a security guard. Chauke said when he returned in the morning and discovered what had happened, he started praying and fasting. On Monday 3 January, he found some of his belongings dumped not far from his house and said he would continue praying until he found the thieves. “I am angry with these thugs stealing from us and terrorising the community.

Neighbour Abram Mampane (51) said he didn’t hear anything. He said thugs waited for them to go to sleep before committing their evil acts. Abram said the community would now deal with thugs their own way. Community leader Jacob Mokwana (49) said residents didn’t know what to do any more. “Every time we leave our shacks, we are scared we will come back to find they have been broken into,” he said. Jacob said the community was ready to clean up crime and deal with criminals.
