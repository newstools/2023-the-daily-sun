FIVE people including two foreigners have been arrested for theft of stationery, malicious damage to property and possession of suspected stolen property. They were arrested in Bloemfontein, Free State on Saturday, 7 January after Gonyane Primary School was petrol bombed on Friday, 6 January. The police received information from a resident member who learnt about the break-in at the school and knew of possible suspects in Joe Slovo, Phahameng.

A 20-year-old man was arrested. “Information led to the arrest of the second suspect, while a third suspect was arrested at a house in Dr Lebona Street where the school is situated. Three suspects then led the team to two stores where they sold the stationery. The first store manager (36), who is a foreigner, was arrested in Bataung Street. Another store manager (37), who is also a foreigner, was arrested. Different types of books, rulers, erasers, pens, pencils, sharpeners and other kinds of stationery was recovered from the stores,” said Covane. The Free State Department of Education said due to load shedding, a number of schools have been the target of criminals, break-ins, vandalism, as well as theft. The suspects are expected to appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court today. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments
