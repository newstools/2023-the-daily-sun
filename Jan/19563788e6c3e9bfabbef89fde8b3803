THERE were mixed feelings when pupils in KZN, Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Northern Cape started their first day of school on Wednesday. Daily Sun visited Sibonise Primary School in J Section in KwaMashu, north of Durban. Teachers had a hard time as they wipes grade R pupils’ teary faces, running noses and made sure they stopped crying and settled down in the classrooms. Some didn’t cry but sat down, opened their lunch boxes and started enjoying their food. Others enjoyed being in class and were excited. Meanwhile, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga and KZN Premier Nomusa Dube-Ncube visited several schools in Umlazi, Parlock (Newlands West) and La Mercy to monitor the opening of schools in the province, in an attempt to ensure it was smooth and incident-free. In the Eastern Cape, some pupils at Elundini Primary School in Motherwell, Nelson Mandela Bay were visibly anxious when the bell rang to signify the start of the day. Indiphile Ganada clung to her mother’s legs when she tried to leave. Indiphile even tried to escape, but her teacher, Vuyiseka Mdoda, brought her back into the classroom. But there were some pupils who rushed to their classrooms as they were excited to meet their new classmates. Parent Nombulelo Goniwe said: “My boy was so excited to start school that he woke me up early, but he ran away from the classroom and refused to enter. He may not be used to this number of people, but it won’t take long for him to adapt.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments Elundini principal Ntsiki Bono said they were ready for teaching and learning. “Our main challenge is the issue of late registration. “We’re doing our best to make sure there’ll be a place for those who register their kids at the last minute,” said Bono.
