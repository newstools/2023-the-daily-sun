Leagues, Alliance and the Free State delegation, and there will be eight provincial hubs." "The Conference can only be joined from one of the
hubs. Since Conference was adjourned, credentials remain unchanged and delegates are therefore
requested to bring along their tags," he said. Some of the things expected to be discussed in the
conference are the amendments to the ANC's constitution which required a two-thirds
majority of all delegates. Mbalula said they will also be discussing policy adoptions
amongst other things.
