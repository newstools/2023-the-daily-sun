BEATEN and stoned, Lucky Maselesele lay dying on the street in Alexandra, Joburg. “I am dying. Please help me,” were allegedly the last words spoken by the former Kaizer Chiefs midfield maestro, Maselesele, before he died. Maselesele was murdered after being accused of stealing electrical cables in October 2021. According to witness Zinhle Maseko, who testified in the South Gauteng High Court on Wednesday, the two men who attacked the former soccer star left and then came back to finish him off. “We were trying to help him call his relatives and police when we saw them coming back. We ran back inside our yard and closed the gate,” said the crying Maseko, who refused to look at the photos of the crime scene shown to her by the prosecutor. She said one of the men beat Maselesele with bricks and the other kicked him while he was bitten by a dog. Maseko said she also heard the sound of a bottle being smashed but did not see who broke it. She said when the men left for the second time, they went back to check on the victim. She said Maselesele could not clearly remember his relatives’ contact details. “He told us he was dying and we must help him. I realised it was not going well with him and I ran away and went to stand next to the gate.” She said she ran away because she was scared of dead people.
