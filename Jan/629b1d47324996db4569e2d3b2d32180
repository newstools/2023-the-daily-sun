MANDLA Mahlangu had been smoking nyaope for eight years. But he decided to quit after his mother died in December 2020. He now thanks the traditional healer who helped to stop his nyaope craving. Mandla said he lived with the traditional healer from last January until May. “I never went to rehab but was treated by a sangoma. I drank izimbiza and used herbs. When the withdrawal attacked, the sangoma would put me in steam. I also used an enema,” he said. The 33-year-old from Mountain View near KwaMhlanga, Mpumalanga, told Daily Sun he had now been sober for three years. “My heart was so painful after my mum’s death. It came into my heart that I should stop smoking nyaope. I had to man up and take responsibility by looking after my siblings. I no longer mix with the friends I used to smoke with. When I see them now my blood boils,” he said. Mandla said that his biggest challenge now was to be accepted by the community as people still regarded him as a junkie. “I want to make it clear that I’m now clean and responsible. I’m trying very hard to work and support my family. People still don’t take me seriously. They hire me to do work for them but still see me as that nyaope boy who terrorised the community. When they pay, they always ask what am I going to do with the money,” he said. Mandla said he did wall plastering, bricklaying, house roofing, brick making and also cleaned yards. Mandla’s sister, Khesi (35), said they were happy their brother was back. “He is like the prodigal son. It pained us to see him smoke nyaope and become a useless person. We are happy that our brother is clean. He is the man of the house. We pray that he doesn’t relapse,” she said. Thando Masango of Ikakarambha Foundation, also a former junkie, said it was not easy to quit unless it came from the heart. “I respect Mandla for fighting hard to claim his life back,” he said.
