ESKOM has been instructed to repair the damaged Witsieshoek substation and restore power to the residents of QwaQwa in the Free State. Scores of areas including Phuthaditjhaba, Clubview and some villages have been without electricity since 18 December and disgruntled residents celebrated Christmas and New Year in the dark. The Maluti-a-Phofung Municipality filed court papers in an attempt to force the power utility to fix the long overdue damaged substation. The court has ordered that Eskom should start with the process of repairing and restoring power with immediate effect.  The power utility was demanding Maluti-a-Phofung to pay R300 million before it could start the restoration of Witsieshoek substation. Titi Makhetha of the Eskom communication and stakeholders management told Daily Sun that Eskom will comply with the instructions, even though there was still a substantial amount of money outstanding. “We have already commenced with the outstanding repairs,” said Makhetha.
