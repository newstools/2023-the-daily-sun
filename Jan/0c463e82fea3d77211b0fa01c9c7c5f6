RESIDENTS of Rolle outside Thulamahashe, Mpumalanga, are living in fear. This is because hippos are stalking the village. Frightened villagers have had to run for their lives after spotting the hippos roaming the village on Friday, 6 January, while making their way to Mutlumuvi and N’wandlamharhi rivers. Induna Guguma Mayinga said the villagers have been warned to stay away from the deadly creatures and rivers. “We received a report from frightened farmers and herd boys about the hippos stalking our village. But no death or injuries have been reported so far. “So we warned them to stay out of the rivers. We are happy the rangers are searching for them and will capture them soon,” he said. Fisherman Amos Mkhabela (38) said: “We saw the hippos lurk in the water. We are aware of the danger.” Another fisherman, Gilbert Mathebula (47), said: “I spotted a large hippo on a giant rock. It dashed into the water when it saw me.” Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency spokeswoman Kholofelo Nkambule said: “We are constantly being notified of this and our rangers continue to work hard to search for them to ensure a safe environment for the community members. We appeal to the community members to keep us posted if they see them in other areas.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments
