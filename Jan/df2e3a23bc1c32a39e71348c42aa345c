EFF Students’ Command (EFFSC) members, led by their president Sihle Lonzi, left the EFF headquarters in the Joburg CBD on Wednesday, 25 January on their walk to the Union Buildings in Tshwane. They said they were expecting that it would take them 16 hours to get there to deliver their memorandum. Tebogo Sako of the student council said they chose to walk to show that they were serious, and to alert other students that their plight was being taken seriously. Sako said some of their demands included the scrapping of all student debt, especially for those who come from poor households. He said they also wanted free registration and absorption of all students who have registered and met the tertiary requirements. “We have students who are eager to study and have met the requirements but because of a lack of funds and historical debt they are forced to stay at home,” said Sako. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments “Every child deserves education and we cannot allow their poverty to deprive them of that.” Sako also said they wanted walk-in applications to be allowed because of issues with online applications and registrations. He said most students are left frustrated by the system of online applications because some come from schools where they don’t have advanced technology. He said the EFF has also decided that they’ll be going to all tertiary institutions to help students who are going to register.
