A FIGHT after a funeral has left one man dead and another hurt. A man (35) was shot dead and a 46-year-old suspect has been charged with murder after being rushed to hospital following the incident that occurred at Phomolong in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, on Saturday. Following the shooting, angry residents caught the suspect, burnt and assaulted him before police came to his rescue. Rabie Ridge police spokesman Sergeant Jacob Nhlongo said when cops arrived on the scene, they found one man dead and the residents assaulting the suspect. He said it was unclear what the fight was about after the men were seen together at a funeral earlier in the day.  A witness told Daily Sun that he saw the suspect shoot the victim, as did other community members. “This man clearly planned this because why would he take a gun to a funeral? You must be SIGNED IN to comment! “It doesn’t make sense. They didn’t even argue for long before he pulled out a gun and shot him,” said the witness. Another resident said they were tired of crime in Tembisa and if fixing the problem meant burning criminals one by one, they would do it. “We are tired of such things. We’re not safe in our own communities and it’s about time we did something about it,” said the resident. Members of the victim’s family said they needed time to deal with their loss and didn’t want to comment.
