OFTEN when cops find suspects with muthi armbands and small bottles of muthi, suspects confess to have a sangoma working with them. Cops recently met izangoma to ask them to fight crime and not aid tsotsis to get away with their evil acts. Police warned izangoma that in future, they’ll be considered to be accomplices to crime if they keep helping thugs. Sergeant Daphney Phooko said the meeting was held to encourage izangoma to work with cops to fight the crime. CPF leader Zola Nongogo said suspects often talk about being helped by izangoma. “They have muthi on their bodies to avoid getting caught. But some end up being bust,” said Nongogo. “It’s worrying because there are some fake izangoma who believe that their work is to help thugs and not to help building the nation.” Gogo Muntu Segage, Traditional Healers Organisation chairperson and senior promoter at Etwatwa branch, said fake izangoma were damaging the reputation of ubungoma.

The organisation keeps reminding izangoma of their role in society and that they must know that the law begins in their practice.”
