THE ANC in the Mkhondo Municipality in Mpumalanga managed to reclaim the mayoral seat following an urgent council sitting on Wednesday, 25 January. The sitting followed a request by councillors for a special meeting to table a motion of no confidence against former mayor Mthokozisi Simelane and the speaker, Melusi Dlamini. In a letter sent to Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs MEC Mandla Msibi, the councillors complained that the ousted speaker failed to convene a council meeting they had requested twice. The sitting came as a result of vacancies in the council, which were created by the expulsion of former Mkhondo mayor, Vusi Motha, and other councillors. The councillors were expelled after they voted with the opposition in a sitting in 2021. REGISTER TO COMMENT! Ngilosi Ndlovu was elected mayor with 20 votes out of 35 people who participated, while Mduduzi Ngwenya was elected as speaker of the council. The African Transformation Movement, EFF and DA members absconded. In her acceptance speech, Ndlovu said they didnâ€™t want to make promises of service delivery but bring services to residents. She said councillors must bring new life and hope to the citizens of Mkhondo. Msibi said Mkhondo has not been delivering services to the people and that the department tried its level best to intervene. He said everybody must do their work to provide services to the people. ANC secretary Muzi Chirwa said the election of the new council members means that the ANC must continue to pay particular attention to the needs of the people, especially in ensuring that they deliver the necessary basic services, run credible public participation and ensure they fight corruption, especially in the municipality.
