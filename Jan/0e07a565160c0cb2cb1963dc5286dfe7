HUNDREDS of children were reunited with their parents and guardians through Identikidz tags over Christmas. The City of Cape Town said during the festive season, residents lost their kids at the beach. So, the municipality came up with a plan to put tags with phone numbers of parents on their hands. And, it worked as many kids were helped to reunite with their parents. Community Services and Health MMC Patricia van der Ross said the city tagged more than 90 000 kids at 16 participating beaches. Between 15 December and 2 January, Identikidz reunited 369 with their families while 13 were taken to the Department of Social Development.

We are providing a service that offers peace of mind, especially on our busy beach days. We want to thank families who made use of the service and the staff,” she said. Beachgoer Thulisile Conjwa (43) said the programme gave them peace of mind. “Kids run all over the beach and you can’t follow them all the time. When you can’t find them, you wait to receive a call to fetch them,” she said.
