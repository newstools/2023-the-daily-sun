AHEAD of the highly anticipated ANC provincial conference in the Free State, well-known TikTok user and self-proclaimed sangoma Dr 911 says convener of the Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) Mxolisi Dukwana will come out victorious. Dr 911 said the ancestors instructed him to take seven days praying for Dukwana, and told him that he would win as provincial chairman and become premier. A video of the sangoma consulting with the ancestors has gone viral on social media. “During 2020, I told my TikTok followers that 2023 will be a miracle year. This is the right time for Dukwana to take the lead. The angels are ready to give him the throne he deserves,” he said. IPC spokesman Oupa Khoabane said they were aware of the video, but distanced the party and convener from it.  “Indeed, like most South Africans, we have also learnt of it, but the convener does not know anything of the sangoma. Maybe it’s a sangoma’s wish to see Dukwana on the chairman seat,” said Khoabane. Dukwana is in the race with Education MEC Dr Tate Makgoe, former Mangaung Metro mayor Thabo Manyoni, Ace Magashule’s big ally Vusi Tshabalala and Premier Sisi Ntombela. The conference had previously been postponed following divisions within the party and ongoing court battles. Registration began on Thursday, 18 January, and the party deployed national executive committee delegations to oversee differences that had been threatening to collapse the conference.
