THE ANC has slammed the leadership of the City of Tshwane after it emerged there were negative findings in its audit report. In a leaked report by Auditor-General Tsakani Maluleke, R10 billion of irregular expenditure was flagged. The report suggested that the municipality had been manipulating its financial statements to hide irregularities. During a media briefing on Wednesday, 11 January, the ANC in the Greater Tshwane Region said the report proved its view that the DA-led coalition was incompetent, corrupt and could not lead the capital city. Secretary George Matjila said in the past seven years, the coalition had jumped from one scandal to the next. “The lame excuse for failing to provide a safe community, clean water, reliable public transport and clean water was that the ANC was to be blamed,” he said. Matjila said the party was appalled by the silence of ActionSA and the Freedom Front Plus on the current state of affairs.

Coalition government spokesman Corne Mulder said all political parties remained clear in their view that the audit outcome was unacceptable. He said the coalition oversight group received information that a number of the audit findings arose from seemingly deliberate actions of the former chief financial officer to mislead the municipality and undersupply information to the auditor-general. “The coalition oversight group has concluded to meet again in the coming days. The focus of this meeting will be the issue of political consequence management,” added Mulder.
