RESIDENTS of Kamaqhekeza outside Komatipoort, Mpumalanga, were left speechless after the gruesome discovery of the semi-decomposed body of a man on Friday, 6 January. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the unknown man was found floating in the stream that runs across the build-up area next to a bridge on the R571 from Mananga Port of Entry and Komatipoort. “A caller notified the police, who were met with the semi-decomposed body of a middle-aged man. It is suspected that the body has been on the stream for some time as the face has lost recognition, but the body is still intact. The cause of death is yet to be established,” he said.  Mohlala said the provincial management was hoping to locate the man’s family. “Police urge community members who might have lost a loved one befitting the description to help them identify the body,” he said.
