SINCE she was a young girl, the 51-year-old woman has had visions and dreams – but her gobela has taken all that away from her. The woman from Spruitview in Ekurhuleni told Daily Sun that her gobela, who also used to be her boyfriend ephehlweni, has blocked her spiritual gift. She said she stayed at her gobela’s place in Tshwane for eight months and during this time they fell in love, but she made it clear that when she left, she’d go back to her husband at home. “He understood and never mistreated me even after that conversation,” she said. But a month before her graduation, he told her she shouldn’t leave and they could build a life together. “I reminded him that I had a husband at home, but he didn’t take it well,” she said. A week after she went home, he called her and threatened to block her gift. “He told me he won’t let me go that easily,” she said. She didn’t take his threat seriously, but three months later, her visions were blocked and her bones disappeared.

This happened in July last year and she said she’s still blocked. “I tried to reach out to him, but he has blocked my number. “I used my friend’s phone, but he hung up as soon as he heard my voice,” she said. Daily Sun spoke to the friend (49),who said she’s also been seeking help for her friend. “I was disappointed when she told me about her fling with her gobela, but this man is wrong for what he did,” she said. The gobela (43) denied ever being in a relationship with her, and said he doesn’t even know how to block people’s gifts. When pressed with more questions, he hung up. The woman’s family doesn’t know about this matter.
