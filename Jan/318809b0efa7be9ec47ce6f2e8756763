THE family of Thembinkosi Goje is demanding justice for their son. The 29-year-old farm worker was allegedly shot and killed by the farm owner in Odendaalsrus, Free State on Friday, 13 January. Thembinkosi was patrolling with two other colleagues when the accused joined them and allegedly shot Thembinkosi. It’s alleged that the day before, the two had a squabble, which led to the accused violently assaulting Thembinkosi. Thembinkosi tried to open a case at Odendaalsrus cop shop, but the police allegedly refused to help him. Family representative, Nombulelo Mokoena, said Thembinkosi had been working for the accused for a long time without any reports of fighting.  “We need to know what the motive behind the killing was. He was forced to go on patrol with a gun wound until he collapsed. Our son was killed in cold blood. He was not a criminal. He was working hard to feed his eight-year-girl. “We hope justice prevails regardless of the skin colour of the accused. The pain of losing a father in such a horrific manner will never be forgotten by his daughter and the family. We’ve lost a real soldier,” said Nombulelo. Captain Steven Thakeng said Thembinkosi sustained a shot wound on the right side of the chest. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments “He later collapsed and was certified dead at the scene.
