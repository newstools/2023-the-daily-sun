LERATO Mkhwanazi (33) was living in fear and wanted to abandon her home because some residents didn’t want her in the kasi. They had even signed a petition to kick her out. But after Lerato’s story was published, community leaders in Barcelona, Etwatwa, sat down with Lerato and the people who wanted her to leave.

Last week, Lerato who had more than four protection orders against her neighbours, found herself holding hands with her neighbours to make peace. She said she was not free to live in her home until the People’s Paper intervened. “I would like to thank the People’s Paper for feeling my pain. It was not easy for me, but you came through for me,” she said “Finally, I will have peace in my life and the courage to stay in my parents’ home. Thank you for saving my life,” she said. Lerato said she is not a home wrecker. “I have my own boyfriend.” Commander of patrollers in Barcelona, Jacob Africa, said they were happy that the matter was finally resolved. George Sukazi of Mokgoba’s Men Forum was one of the panel members who came to mediate in Lerato’s matter. He said: “We found that Lerato’s case is harboured on a pure jealousy. She’s working and the people who were making her life a hell are unemployed. They feel Lerato is succeeding as she’s getting one job after another.” George said they also realised that there’s a person who was fuelling the patrollers to be against Lerato.
