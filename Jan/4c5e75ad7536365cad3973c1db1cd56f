KWAITO legend and businessman Arthur Mafokate’s attempt to clear his name has flopped. He took to YouTube on Friday 19 January for an interview, saying he was setting the record straight, after he was accused of being part of the “Lotto Heist” gang. But viewers were left with more questions than answers, and many were not moved by his tears. ALSO READ : Dr Musa Mthombeni is smitten with his wife Liesl! This comes after the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) recently revealed they were probing the National Lotteries Commission and five non-profit organisations that received grant funding of about R56 million for community development projects. Among these organisations were Mafokate’s South African Art and Development Association. The SIU alleged that he applied for funding to assist unemployed youth in rural and poor areas with music, business, video, film production and dance skills. According to the SIU, a portion of the money was used to pay for Mafokate’s luxurious house in Midrand, Joburg. In the interview, led by Danny Mdluli, Mafokate claimed the allegations against him were not true and had damaged his reputation. He said he was speaking up as his daughter (10) questioned him about the allegations after hearing about it at school. “On Tuesday, I fetched her again from school and she said ‘papa, they say you stole R6 000’,” he said. When asked which allegations were untrue, Mafokate became emotional, breathing heavily and fidgeting. But viewers said it was as an act.
