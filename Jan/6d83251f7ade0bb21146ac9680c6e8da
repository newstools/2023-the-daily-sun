THEIR hard work, dedication and expert assistance with extra classes over the weekends has paid off. Matriculants from Ekurhuleni said the Karabo Centre for Mathematics, Science and Commerce based at the Vosloorus Comprehensive School is a beacon of hope for kasi pupils. It has helped them improve their school performance and achieve excellent matric results. The centre obtained 97 distinctions from 82 pupils who wrote the matric examinations last year, with distinctions in science, maths, life sciences and accounting. Lusanda Khanyile from Phumulani Secondary School obtained seven distinctions. She said she joined the centre in 2019 when she was in grade 9 and has now been accepted at Wits University to study medicine. “I’m humbled and grateful to Karabo for changing my life,” she said. Keevon Jacobs from Reiger Park Secondary School got six distinctions and said: “The centre provided me with all the necessary learning resources.” Gontse Modisane from PT Xulu Secondary, who obtained six distinctions, said he’s grateful for the centre, which was established in 2012. Its chairman, Collin Forka, said they solely depend on sponsors. “We lost many of our funders due to Covid-19 and are appealing for funding to sustain our programme,” said Forka.
