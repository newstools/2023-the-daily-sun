ONLY a reckless gambler would bet against Mamelodi Sundowns going all the way to clinch their sixth consecutive DStv Premiership title. Sundowns continued with their astronomical form, defeating TS Galaxy 2-1 at Mbombela Stadium in Mpumalanga on Tuesday night. The bare statistics state that Sundowns’ win, secured by Rushine De Reuck’s header and Peter Shalulile’s tap-in puts them 19 points clear of Richards Bay, who are second in the log. The first goal which, was scored in the 11th minute, came at a cost as De Reuck was substituted immediately after scoring as he suffered a concussion and was replaced by Brian Onyango. Shalulile sealed the three points for Sundowns in the 64th minute taking his tally to eight league goals this season. With this convincing victory, there’s no lingering doubt about the pedigree of this Sundowns team that has now won 16, lost twice and drew once in their 19 league games.

In the first round, Galaxy stunned Sundowns 1-0 in Pretoria but that propelled The Brazilians as they have lost once (to SuperSport United) since then and went on to set a record of 13-match winning streak with last night’s result. Sundowns fully merited the victory. Galaxy did not show any threat throughout the match and Sundowns could have scored more with Gaston Sirino fluffing most of their chances. In the dying minutes of the match, Djakaridja Traore scored his fourth goal of the season getting a consolation for Galaxy from a spot kick after Dennis Onyango fouled Lefa Hlongwane in the box. The Rockets have now gone five matches without winning a game.
