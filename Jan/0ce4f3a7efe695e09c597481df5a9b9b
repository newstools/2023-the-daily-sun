THE search for drugs in Ekurhuleni is continuing – and druglords and dealers are feeling the heat! Taximen and concerned residents said they are not going to stop now. And now some druglords are fleeing from the Springs area, fearing for their lives. In a video, a pastor is caught at a house in Springs where he was allegedly found with drugs and muthi. In another video, an alleged druglord is seen being forced to eat a white powder substance believed to be cocaine. He tries to protest but is promised a beating with a sjambok. He is left with no choice but to swallow the powder. REGISTER TO COMMENT! The taximen and the residents said the clampdown has been going on for three weeks. They said they don’t want police to stand in their way as they have failed them. “We know some of the Springs police benefit from these druglords and that’s why they are not doing anything,” said one taximan. The drug search came after a nyaope addict at the taxi rank was accused of stealing from the commuters. Sergeant Themba Tshabalala of Springs Police Station said no case has been opened as the group contaminated the evidence. He said people who claim the police are involved are welcomed to bring evidence.
