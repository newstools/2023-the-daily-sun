AT FIRST, she didn’t have a problem with the tokoloshe eating her food. But now the creature has graduated to choking her and she fears for her life! The 39-year-old woman from Edenvale in Ekurhuleni, who didn’t want to be named, said for the past four years, the tokoloshe has been terrorising her for the entire month of January. She said when it started happening, she would wake up and all her food would be gone. “I decided to set an alarm to check if something was really eating my food at night, or if I was crazy,” she said. The woman said she found a short creature with messy hair on top of her stove. “I remember passing out and waking up in my kitchen at about 5am, freezing cold,” she said.

I’m scared because this thing will end up killing me,” she said. The woman said she was afraid of going to her daughter’s house because the tokoloshe might follow her and terrorise her grandchild. “I’ve sprinkled salt around my house, I’ve used holy ash and I’ve burnt imphepho, but none of these things are working,” she said. Sangoma Gogo Lesedi Mokoena said the fact that the tokoloshe was not harmful at first showed it was not meant to be sent to her. She said it had become violent because the woman saw it.
