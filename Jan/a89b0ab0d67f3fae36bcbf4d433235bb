THREE people were killed in Gugulethu on the evening of Saturday, 14 January. The motive for the killing at a house opposite the popular Cash Tavern in NY112 kasi was unclear. The victims were shot while an umgidi was taking place two houses away. Many residents were left traumatised. A resident said: “I was attending umgidi and was shocked to hear gunshots outside. “A lot of people were shocked and hid because they thought the shots were coming from inside the house. “About 10 minutes after the shooting, people went outside to find a person lying outside the yard of a nearby house with more bodies inside.” Residents told the SunTeam they suspected the killings were connected with extortion gangs in the area. It’s alleged the killers parked their car behind those belonging to guests at the umgidi. “People thought they were guests and nobody suspected they were on a mission to kill,” said a resident. The SunTeam visited the family at the house where the incident took place but no one was willing to talk. Police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andre Traut said three men, aged 38, 40 and of unknown age, were killed. A fourth victim is fighting for his life in hospital. No arrests have been made yet.
