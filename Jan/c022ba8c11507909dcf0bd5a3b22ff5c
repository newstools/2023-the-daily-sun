PARENTS have been complaining about overcrowding at schools for years. But this year, there has been an improvement with the introduction of mobile classrooms. Although some grade Rs were sad when schools opened on Wednesday 11 January, it was a happy day for most. School Governing Body chairman Simon Sengene, of Sediba sa Thuto Primary in Mamelodi, Tshwane, said the day was stressful for parents and teachers. He said they were happy that things were progressing. Esethu Dyubeni (24) said her daughters Siphesihle and Hope Maseko (6) were starting grade 1. “This year is better than last year as no one is complaining about overcrowding,” she said.   Dipuo Madisha (36) said her son, Lucky (9), was transferred to Phomolong Primary in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, and she was happy he got a place. Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi and Education MEC Matome Chiloane were in Ga-Rankuwa to officiate the handover of Mapenane Secondary.
