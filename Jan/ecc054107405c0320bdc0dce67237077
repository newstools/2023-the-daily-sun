THE search for an escaped tiger in the Midvaal continues as tracing teams only found new tracks in the mountains around midday. This means Sheba is still in the mountains. Community Policing Forum leader Gresham Mandy told Daily Sun that the tiger had not yet been recaptured, despite a search throughout the night on Sunday. Sheba had escaped on Friday.

According to Mandy, more tactical teams, farmers and the owner of the tiger gathered in the early hours of Monday morning to begin with the search. The streets were empty with no people walking around as the community around stayed indoors fearing the tiger. Daily Sun published an article on Monday, 16 January about the tiger, which injured a man over the weekend. The owner of the tiger told the SunTeam the tiger will come back home but he fears that many people might get injured or be killed by the tiger when they get face-to-face with it, he said. Mandy warned residents to be on high alert. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments
