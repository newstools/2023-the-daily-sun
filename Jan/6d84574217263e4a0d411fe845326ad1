GIFT of the Givers is overwhelmed by people who have been coming to the organisation’s offices, returning items that were recently stolen. Spokesman Ali Sablay said the moment people knew that the goods they bought on the streets were stolen from the non-governmental organisation, they returned them. Ali said one man came back with a bakkie filled with items including 10 boxes of clothes and gas tanks. The man had found them inside his backroom where his drug-addicted son slept, and knew that they were stolen. And so far, about 70% of the items had been recovered. “A father and son came and pulled out with a van. They brought back 10 boxes of clothing, a very sentimental frame to the Gift of the Givers. They brought back our gas tanks and some instruments,” Ali said.  He said that the father told them that the cops had arrested his son, and he felt ashamed that the stolen goods were in his house. “In the morning when Gift of the Givers came to work, the father and his other son were waiting outside. They apologised on behalf of their son and brother,” Ali said. Captain Frederick van Wyk said a case of business breaking was opened at Lansdowne cop shop on Monday. He said members of the Maitland flying squad, SAPS K9, national intervention unit, Metro police, Metro K9 and law enforcement embarked on a search operation after receiving a tip-off. They went and raided four premises in Hanover Park, where the suspected stolen goods were hidden.
