FORMER president Jacob Zuma has welcomed the appointment of a full bench to hear President Cyril Ramaphosa’s application to block his private prosecution case. However, Zuma through his foundation expressed reservations as to why a full bench should hear what he called a frivolous case when the main matter will be heard on 19 January. According to a directive from the Gauteng division of the High Court, the case will now be heard by a full bench of three judges. It will also no longer be heard virtually but physically in the South Gauteng High Court in Joburg. Ramaphosa launched an urgent bid to have his private prosecution by Zuma thrown out, questioning the validity of the certificate issued to Zuma among other grounds. This after Zuma on the eve of the ANC national conference served summons to privately prosecute Ramaphosa for failing to act in his complaint about the leakage of his medical records. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments  Zuma is also privately prosecuting NPA Advocate Billy Downer, who he alleges leaked his medical records to News24 journalist Karyn Maughan, who is also a co-accused in the private prosecution case. Ramaphosa wants this matter thrown out and has until Tuesday, 10 January, to file an answering affidavit after Zuma filed an opposing affidavit on Friday. The matter will now be heard on Thursday, 12 January. Jacob Zuma Foundation spokesman Mzwanele Manyi is not particularly excited that three judges will hear the matter.  He questioned why the judiciary would insist on three judges hearing the matter when in normal circumstances, it would be applicants to make such a request. “Is this perhaps one of those exceptional/exclusive treatments for the all important President Ramaphosa? Would an ordinary citizen be given this kind of attention? Are we all equal before the law?” asked Manyi.
