IT has been the worst performing school in the Gauteng West district for the last four years. In 2021, Kgothalang Secondary from Bekkersdal scored a dismal 41,5%. This convinced the Department of Education to bring in a new principal to improve things – and he has turned them around by motivating teachers and pupils. The school achieved an 87,3% pass rate in 2022, becoming one of the best performing in the district. It achieved 44 bachelor passes, 44 diplomas and 22 higher certificates with 16 matrics not making it. This warranted a message of appreciation from Education MEC Matome Chiloane on a job well done. Caretaker principal Barnard Rampaku showed to Daily Sun the award they received for the improvement. Chiloane said most township schools excelled in the 2022 matric examinations. A 100% pass rate was achieved by 20 schools with 134 achieving over 90%. Rampaku urged pupils and teachers to work even harder. Proud parent Lillian Mvelase said: “Our children are more motivated. We hope this year’s matriculants will maintain the standard or even do better.” You must be SIGNED IN to comment!
