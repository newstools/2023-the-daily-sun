ISAAC Mohlambi (87) told Daily Sun if it wasn’t for the pit bull catching the cow, they would have lost the cow. Mohlambi from Sebokeng zone 12 in the Vaal said it was in the morning last month when the family’s cow jumped the wall of the sangoma’s yard while they were doing rituals. “While they were busy, the cow escaped and ran around the streets. The community joined in to try and catch the imfihlo, but it left several people hurt before it was stopped by the dog,” he said. Mohlambi thanked Bongane Radebe and his pit bull. He said there was no way the sangoma was going to find the animal if it wasn’t for Bongane and his dog. “The family would have lost a lot of money because they had paid for the cow and it could have injured many more people. It had already injured two people who were taken to clinic,” he said. Nthabiseng Modise (37) said the dog helped her family because they could have spent the entire day running after the cow, and her sister was not going to have a cow.  Modise said the dog is well-trained as it didn’t attack anyone. “It listened to its owner when he told it to stop after community members had tied up the cow,” she said. “The dog surprised the people. Its owner communicated with it and it was very friendly with everyone. The people really loved the dog.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments Bongane told the SunTeam he came face to face with the crazy cow while walking home with his dog. “I decided to let my dog go and ordered it to deal with the cow,” he said. “My dog saved my life and three gogos who were next to the cow. He saved the day for Modise’s family.” “Everyone praised the dog as a hero of the day,” said Bongane.
