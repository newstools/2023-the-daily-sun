THE City of Ekurhuleni has recovered about R3 million from three Germiston-based companies that were owing millions of rands in unpaid services. On Tuesday, 24 January, the perpetrators saw municipality officials arriving unannounced to cut off electricity. Nine businesses, owing the city more than R21 million, were targeted by a multi-departmental task team on a mission to cut off the supply of electricity and water in an effort to recover the money. Supply to some of the businesses was cut off after they ignored numerous requests to pay the outstanding debt. REGISTER TO COMMENT! City spokesman Zweli Dlamini said businesses that were able to pay half of their debt and made arrangements for the balance were reconnected. “Two of the disconnected businesses were also fined about R24 000 for illegally connecting electricity.” Dlamini added that the disconnected businesses would be closely monitored until they settled the debt, and the blitz would continue until money was recovered.
