After refusing to attend court sessions in the past, Zandile
Christmas Mafe finally appeared at Western Cape High Court on Friday morning, 9
February. His appearance was not without drama as he started shouting
while being taken to the holding cells of the court. Mafe was shouting that the
court and the prosecutor must not mention the word “Valkenberg” in court. This is after the court heard that both the State and the
defence have agreed that Mafe needs to be referred for mental observation. Mafe
refuses to be taken back to Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital where he was once
taken after his arrest in January 2022. Mafe’s lawyer advocate Dali Mpofu told Judge Nathan Erasmus
that Mafe told him that there is nothing wrong with him. Mpofu said his
client’s refusal could be due to his experience with the mental institution.
The experience referred to by Mpofu was not presented in court. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments The State through prosecutor advocates Mervyn Menigo argued
that Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital was a designated facility for Mafe’s
observation. This is after the defence suggested two other two facilities,  Lentegeur Hospital and Stikland Hospital
which Menigo argues that they were rehabilitation facilities. However, Valkenberg comes with its own challenges as the
place does not have enough space at the moment. If Mafe is to be admitted to
Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital facility he will have to be on the waiting list
which he may have to queue for 10 months. With the current backlog standing at
111, Mafe will be number 112. Judge Erasmus postponed the pretrial for two weeks and
ordered the parties to table a report before him looking at a suitable facility
and at the suggestion of an independent psychiatrist who will form part of the
panel observing Mafe.
