AFTER several talks, the South African government has decided that it won’t grant slain rapper, Kiernan “AKA” Forbes, a state funeral. Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi met with the Forbes family at AKA’s home in Bryanston, Joburg, to let them know that the government won’t be burying the musician. AKA lost his life after he was shot outside a restaurant on Florida Road in Durban on Friday, 10 February. Today, 16 February 2023, Lesufi visited the family of the late hip-hop star to let them know about government’s decision. In their statement, it was stated that the premier informed the family of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to decline the request by the Gauteng Provincial Government to grant the artist a special provincial official funeral.

Lesufi thought it was a great idea to offer the musician a provincial honour by providing law enforcement support, a gravesite at the Heroes’ Acre Cemetery, and a flag to drape the casket.

We want to drape the coffin, provide a gravesite at Heroes’ Acre Cemetery, with flags flying at half-mass. We will ensure that his funeral is befitting,” said Lesufi. The premier expressed that he was in discussion with Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa on their attendance of the send-off ceremony.
