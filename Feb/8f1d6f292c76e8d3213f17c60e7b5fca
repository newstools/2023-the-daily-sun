FIRST it was a leopard, then it was another now – and now it’s a crawling reptile. Residents of Matsulu in Mpumalanga have been warned to keep their eyes and ears opened because a monster crocodile was spotted on Monday, 13 February. In videos circulating on social media, the crocodile is seen crossing the road towards a shack not far from the overflowing Crocodile River. Residents are following it while taking photos and videos. It is raining so bad in Mpumalanga that even crocodiles are drowning in water and this one decided to escape the flooding river.

This river has many crocodiles and they’re dangerous.” Ntombi Nkosi said it would have been a tragedy if kids had spotted the crocodile. Last year, a young man fought off a leopard in the same area after it attacked him and other residents. Since then, the community has been urged not to provoke wild creatures but call authorities trained to deal with them. Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency spokeswoman Kholofelo Nkambule said they only learnt about the crocodile on social media.
