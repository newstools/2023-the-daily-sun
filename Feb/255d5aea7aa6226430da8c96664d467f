THE family of gogo Mamojalefa Molefe has been left devastated after her body was discovered on Tuesday, 7 February. The 60-year-old was found in a pool of blood by a relative at a house in Ditading in Phuthaditjhaba, Free State. The sangoma was allegedly raped and murdered by an 18-year-old. Her husband, Joseph Kheswa (62), told Daily Sun that her sudden death left the family heartbroken. “It would be easier to deal with if it was a natural death. The fact that she was raped and brutally murdered breaks my heart into pieces,” he said. “I can’t imagine my life without my wife. “She was everything to me. We call on the justice system to send the accused to prison for the rest of his life.” Warrant Officer Mmako Mophiring said during an investigation, the suspect was linked to the murder by evidence found in his possession. Sangoma Nomahlozi Mkhelele called on all izangoma to picket outside court when the suspect appeared. “We are going to show the whole world how hurt we are by this brutal death. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments “We want the accused to rot in jail. We will also perform our traditional rituals to make sure that he suffers the consequences,” she said. The suspect briefly appeared in the Makwane Magistrates Court on Thursday, 9 February, on charges of rape and murder. The case was postponed to Wednesday, 15 February.
