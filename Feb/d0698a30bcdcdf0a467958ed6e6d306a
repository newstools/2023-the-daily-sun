THE streets of Kanana kasi near Orkney in Dr Kenneth Kaunda District Municipality, North West, came to a standstill on Tuesday, 14 February. District Mayor Nikiwe Num and social development MEC Boitumelo Moiloa led a peaceful march against gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF) in the North West. “The girl child and women in our communities no longer feel safe due to the high levels of GBV targeted at them. We must claim back our streets and homes!” Num said. The mayor said her office saw it fit to highlight the plight of women and children during Valentine’s Day, due to the multiple murders and GBVF incidents recently experienced in Kanana by women at the hands of their lovers. “As government, we are committed to intensifying the war on GBVF not only today, but for 365 days of the year,” Moiloa said.

There, the local men’s forum pledged that “not in our name will we allow GBVF to continue”. Communities were also encouraged by police not to look away, but to help report incidents of GBVF, before it’s too late. One of the cases which was labelled as GBV was the murder case of Jennifer Mohlomi-Kula, the wife of ANC MP Sibusiso Kula. He is still in custody for allegedly killing her in November.
