A SHOOT-OUT between the police and robbery suspects ensued in the Vereeniging CBD, Vaal, on Friday morning, 10 February. This was after four thugs stormed into a shop and took an undisclosed amount of money before fleeing the scene. But one suspect surrendered to the police after a shoot-out. Police spokesman Captain Fikile Funda told Daily Sun that a 30-year-old male suspect has been apprehended following the robbery. Funda said it was reported that four armed men stormed into a store as the owner was opening for business. While the suspects were still busy in the shop, a passerby witnessed the incident and alerted members of the community. According to Funda, members of the community pursued the suspects who fled in a Nissan Almera. Community members met cops from the K9 Unit who were patrolling at De Villiers Street and the officers joined the chase. The suspects abandoned their car, fled on foot and started shooting at the cops. Funda said one suspect was arrested while three managed to get away.
