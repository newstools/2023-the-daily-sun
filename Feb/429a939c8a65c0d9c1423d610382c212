Two suspects fled the scene and a chase ensued through a takeaway shop and over the back wall, where both tried hiding in a room,” said Smith. “However, a quick-thinking resident locked both suspects inside. They were the last two to get arrested. Both vehicles were seized, as well as several items suspected to be stolen property, along with 100 rounds of high-powered R5 assault rifle ammunition,” he said. A hawker selling vegetables said the thugs were terrorising people and taking their cellphones, wallets and money. “They were using a gun to threaten residents, who would quickly hand over their belongings. They would beat those who didn’t comply. It was chaos, and it happened for about 30 minutes then they drove off. But cops arrived at the right time,” the resident said.
