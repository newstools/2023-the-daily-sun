AFTER months of stressing and entertaining viewers, Scandal!’sMbali has bowed out. The character, played by Nolwazi Ngubeni (39), was introduced to the small screens last year as an innocent and loyal wife who loves and supports her husband, Jojo, played by Melusi Mbele. A few months later, she faked a pregnancy and forced her sister Winnie (Fundiswa Ngcobo) to rape Jojo so she could get pregnant. It’s been a scam after the next with Mbali because she would do anything to be with Jojo. On Wednesday, 15 February Mbali was shot and killed by her mum, played by Makhosazana Ndlovu, who was tired of being terrorised by her. The actress from Durban spoke to SunBuzz about playing Mbali.

I think because limitless, there’s nothing you can’t do when you’re a villain. “Pretty much everything goes. Plus Mbali is hilarious, I find her very funny and I found her quite interesting,” she said. The actress said the character showed her how far she can go as an actress. “This was Mbali’s journey, and I made sure to tell her story with no restrictions. However far I needed to stretch, I would go with her. That’s the fun of it, having to challenge yourself as a performer,” she said.

Sometimes as performers we think we are able to do everything, but if some things don’t work, then let’s find another way to do it,” she said. Although Mbali was a villain, she was also a fan favourite, especially after a scene where she hit Winnie and danced on top of her unconscious body while singing Mlando by Toss, Mdoovar and 9umba. She’ll be making a return on the small screens on Umkhokha on Mzansi from 6 March at 8.30pm.
