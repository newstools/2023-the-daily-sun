SOUTH Africa will lose out on a great opportunity to attract tourists if the R1 billion Tottenham Hotspur deal falls through. Briefing the tourism portfolio committee on Tuesday, 7 February, South African Tourism (SAT) said news about the proposed sponsorship was making waves in the British media, which was positive news for Mzansi. SAT acting CEO Themba Khumalo said if the deal goes through, it would bring value over three years. “If not, we will revert to doing small things, but we won’t reach the target set by the president,” said Khumalo.

That’s why they decided to aggregate those small projects into something big. “In year one, what we would get is that we would be on the training kit of both men and women. We would get onto merchandising and stadium branding,” said Khumalo. He said stadium branding in Europe was more advanced than stadium branding seen in local stadiums. “We would be able to get our message across to impact and induce people not only to be aware, but desire to travel to our destination,” he said. He said in year two, they would be on the first team’s sleeve and training kit.
