GOGO Fastania Mashigo is 100 years old and is still going strong. The SunTeam recently visited the gogo at her home in Soshanguve,  Tshwane, after she had turned 100 years old last month. She gave tips about living a long life and one of the tips stood out. "Take it easy on booze. Alcohol takes away the days of your life if you abuse it," said gogo Fastania. She said she grew up eating vegetables and they've helped to live this long. “We used to eat spinach, samp, sweet potatoes and corn. Those are the things I grew up eating,” she said. She said the only time she ate meat was at Christmas.

Gogo Fastania said her secret to living is the love she has for God and people. She said today's generation lacks respect and they don’t listen to their elders. “Kids of today don’t listen. I keep telling them that I grew up loving people and I had respect for the elderly,” she said. But gogo said she battled a lot when she was still a pupil. “I used to go to school, but I always failed, so I dropped out and started to work at a young age,” she said. Gogo Fastania can still walk, read and sing. “I have been healthy all along, but this year my body is starting to ache,” she said. REGISTER TO COMMENT She said she currently lives in a shack and needs help from good Samaritans to build her a house. “I would like to live in a big house that is mine because when I die, crowds of church people won’t fit in my shack,” she said. Gogo’s daughter, Meseria (61), said she is happy her mom is still alive. “She raised me until I became a pensioner,” she said. She said she would like people to help them build gogo a house.
