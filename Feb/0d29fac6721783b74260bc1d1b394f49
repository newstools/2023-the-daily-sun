President Cyril Ramaphosa says his government is increasing measures to clamp down on violent crimes in the country as people are living in fear. “Violent crime takes a heavy toll on every South African. Communities across our country live in fear for the safety of their families. This situation cannot continue,” said Ramaphosa. He said, to successfully fight crime on the streets, the government is putting more boots on the ground which includes specialised teams that focus on specific times of crimes. “Last year, we undertook to recruit 12 000 new police personnel. Since then, more than 10 000 recruits graduated from police academies and a further 10 000 will be recruited and trained this year,” said Ramaphosa. He said results from some specialised teams are already evident with the breakthrough arrests of kingpins and other suspects of kidnapping, extortion, and illegal mining. POLICE Minister Bheki Cele has commanded all law enforcement agencies to do their job without fear or favour.  Ramaphosa said he is ensuring that the justice system is well-resourced to ensure that when cops arrest suspects, courts can process them effectively. “We are strengthening the South African Police Service to prevent crime and improving the capacity of the National Prosecuting Authority and courts to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice,” he said. Ramaphosa said crimes such as cable theft are destroying the economy and special attention is given to addressing it.
