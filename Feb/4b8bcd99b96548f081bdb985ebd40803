JOYCE Nkuna and her family of 10 will soon say goodbye to the dilapidated shack they called home for many years. This is because they will soon move into a new home. Mpumalanga Human Settlements MEC Speedy Mashilo, Ehlanzeni Mayor Jester Sidell, and City of Mbombela Mayor Sibongile Makushe Mazibuko, recently had a sod turning to mark the building of her house. Mashilo said the house will be finished in two months' time. Joyce (46) from Madras Village in Marite near Bushbuckridge said at last they will finally get the taste of freedom. "God has answered my prayers and I can't wait for the house to be completed. The struggle will be over soon. Life in a shack is unbearable and we have to endure all kinds of weather. The house will change our lives for the better," she said. Mashilo introduced two companies, Sizampilo Projects and Phutimatt Foundation, to build the house.
