A DEVASTATED father has taken to social media to share how his son was killed, allegedly by the child’s mum. The two-year-old was allegedly strangled by his mum in her car at her home in Dobsonville Gardens, Soweto on Saturday, 4 February. The dad said she was playing loud music while doing this. “She then left the scene and the child in the car and went to the police station to hand herself over,” said the dad. He said his head is all over the place and he’s left with so many questions. The man said he did everything he was supposed to do when his child was born. He paid damages and even gifted the family with a cow to cleanse their home. He further questioned if she did this because he’s a present father. “Maybe if I denied the pregnancy and disappeared my son would still be alive.
