RESIDENTS of Siyahlala squatter camp in Philippi were shocked to find the body of a woman on the street. The body was found lying face down next to a yard on Boston Street on Wednesday, 1 February. Residents believe the woman could have been murdered elsewhere and dumped in their kasi. The woman was found with a black handbag, doek and her pink shoes next to her. When residents checked her handbag, they found money, bank cards and an ID. Only her phone was missing. “It is still unclear what happened, but this was not a robbery. “If it was a robbery, thugs would have run away with her handbag. Something is fishy. It appears as if this person was killed somewhere and was dropped in our kasi,” said a resident, Nangamso Jele (39).

The deceased is not familiar and we suspect she is from another area around our kasi,” said another resident who lives close by. Another resident told Daily Sun that around 4am, he drove past the road where the body was found, but there was nothing at the time. “Whoever did this dropped her after 4am. I passed here and didn’t see anything,” he said. Police spokesman Sergeant Wesley Twigg confirmed the incident. He said: “The circumstances surrounding the death of an adult female whose body was discovered on Wednesday morning in Siyahlala informal settlement are under investigation.
