A VIDEO that's being circulated of Jerry Ditshego, who died like Vusi Ma R5, has left his family reeling in shock. In the shocking video, a person can be heard telling the 41-year-old mechanic he's about to die. The man asks Jerry in Tswana: "O ikutkwa byang ge oswa es'khale? (How do you feel knowing you're about to die?)", to which Jerry replies: "Gake stlaela nna (I'm not a fool')." Daily Sun published his story, headlined: "He died just like Ma R5", on 20 February. Jerry, who was from Mabopane in Tshwane, was killed outside a pub in Block C on Friday, 17 February, at about 11pm. According to his family, he was sitting with friends outside when someone called him. When he went to approach that person, he was met by a hail of bullets and died on the scene. Jerry was killed the same way as Bacardi music king Vusi Ma R5, who's real name was Itumeleng Mosoeu. They two lived in the same area and also knew each other.
