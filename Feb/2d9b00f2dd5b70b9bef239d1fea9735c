WHENEVER it rains, the workers are forced to stay at home, while the pupils cannot go to school. The reason is that the gravel road used by villagers of Mogano section in Ga-Sekgopo Village outside Modjadjiskloof, Limpopo, becomes flooded and muddy. Villagers are always left stranded and trapped because they can’t go anywhere when it rains, and motorists trying to make their way through get stuck in the mud. The villagers told Daily Sun they’ve been experiencing this problem for more than 10 years. Sipho Mailula (44) said every time it rains, the road becomes muddy and this limits movement in the area.

Some villagers said the situation gets worse when it rains for several days. Villager Thomas Rampya (39) said shop owners charge them double for deliveries while others refuse to deliver in their area. “Our lives must not come to a standstill because of a problem leaders can easily solve,” he said. People often try to fix the road themselves but as soon as it rains, the road floods again. They said they tried to get the Greater Letaba Municipality to pave the road, but to no avail. Municipal spokeswoman Lovers Maenetje said they’re busy repairing the damage caused by the current rains and will be able to present a plan in due course.
