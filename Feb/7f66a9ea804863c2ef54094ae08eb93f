THE High Court in Malawi has on Monday, 13 February overturned the ruling that South African witnesses in the self-proclaimed Prophet Shepherd Bushiri extradition matter could testify before a court in Mzansi. Bushiri, leader of the Enlightened Christian Gathering Church, his wife Mary made a brief appearance in court. This was after they appealed the ruling by Lilongwe’s Chief Resident Magistrate. Initially, the Chief Resident Magistrate ruled that it would be inconvenient, taxing, very costly, unreasonable, or inexpedient to require witnesses to travel to Malawi. Chief Resident Magistrate Madalitso Chimwaza has ruled that South African witnesses in the extradition hearing in Malawi may give evidence in a South African court. But the High Court said they do not see any other reasonable reason why the witness could not travel to Malawi. Presiding over the ruling, Justice Bruno Kalemba said the state should make sure that they bring the witness to Malawi to testify. In an interview, the Bushiris’ lawyer Wapona Kita said he was satisfied with the ruling.
