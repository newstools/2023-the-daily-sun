THREE people, including two former City of Cape Town employees, appeared in court on Wednesday, 8 February, after being arrested for tender corruption. Brett Lucas (47), Jonathan van Rooy (54), Koos Johannes Muller (52) and company JVR Construction CC appeared in the Cape Town Magistrates Court after being bust on Tuesday. It’s alleged that Van Rooy paid Lucas and Muller, attached to the Water and Sanitation division in the city, in order for them to fast-track tender process. And, this led to the city losing more than R200 million. According to Hawks spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Philani Nkwalase, the corrupt activities happened between 2011 and 2017. MADALA PHILLEMON had been dead for a year and it was time to celebrate his life with a tombstone. But nothing could have prepared the Masedi family for what they found when they went to the grave. A HOLE HAD BEEN DUG AT THE GRAVESITE, THE COFFIN HAD BEEN OPENED AND THE BODY WAS GONE!  Nkwalase said Lucas and Muller were allegedly paid to fast-track the tender process in favour of Van Rooy and his company, JVR. They were arrested after the matter was reported to the Hawks by the city.
