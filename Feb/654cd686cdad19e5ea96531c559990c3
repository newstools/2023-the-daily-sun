EXPELLED ANC member Carl Niehaus has announced that he will launch a non-profit organisation on Thursday, 23 February. He said the organisation will aim to advance radical economic transformation, which is seen in other quarters as an attempt to sway ANC leaders to further personal agendas. On Monday, 20 February, Niehaus said the preparatory work has been completed to go on with the formal launch of the organisation. “As we have reported on social media and mainstream media platforms, extensive consultations with many South Africans, various progressive civil society organisations and political parties, laid the foundation for this launch,” he said. Niehaus said they will continue with further consultations and engagements after the launch.
