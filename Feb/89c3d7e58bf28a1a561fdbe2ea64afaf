CO-OPERATIVE Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Minister Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma is urging communities to be cautious when they travel amid heavy rain that continues to batter many parts of the country. Dlamini-Zuma said the disaster management teams are on high alert across the country amid the continuing heavy rain which has already resulted in damage, vehicles being submerged and swept away, homeowners being trapped on roofs, walls collapsing, and shacks and houses being decimated. She said the team is in contact with provincial and local disaster management centres on the ground and is co-ordinating with all the role players. “The disaster teams will continue to monitor the situation and give support on an ongoing basis. Due to the heavy downpour, many areas are flooded, rivers are overflowing across a number of provinces, people have lost property and infrastructure like roads and bridges are also damaged,” she said. She said as per the recent reports from the South African Weather Service (SAWS), the ground in many other areas that have been receiving rain is already saturated, hence the need to be extra vigilant. The minister said there are areas that are known to be prone to flooding. As such, communities are requested to treat these and all other areas as posing potential danger and desist from endangering their lives. You need to be SIGNED IN to comment! “These adverse weather conditions are still not showing any signs of stopping. The public is therefore urged to follow the regular updates and warning messages from the SAWS as it monitors the weather and climate conditions. “I urge communities across the country to provide assistance to those in need and affected by the flooding, especially those displaced as they lost homes,” she said. The minister added that those who are able to donate basic necessities are encouraged to assist by working with municipalities and affected communities themselves.
