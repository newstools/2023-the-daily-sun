AN investigation into the murder of three people and the attempted murder of another led to the arrest of a teacher. The 30-year-old teacher was arrested on Thursday, 2 February, after four people were allegedly assaulted by about seven suspects who accused them of stealing headlights from a VW Polo. Last week, Daily Sun published a story about three young men who were brutally killed after being accused of stealing the lights. The incident occurred on 21 January. A breakthrough has since been made. Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said cases of kidnapping, murder and attempted murder were opened at Diepkloof Police Station and later transferred to the Provincial Serious and Violent Crime Investigation Unit.

More arrests are expected to happen as the investigation continues. The suspect appeared in the Orlando Magistrates Court on Monday, 6 February facing charges of kidnapping, murder and attempted murder. He was not asked to plead. The case was postponed to 14 February. Police urged the community not to take the law into their own hands. The aunt of one of the victims Katlego Letsheli, Charmaine, said the family and Diepkloof residents strongly believe this arrest wouldn’t have happened if the media hadn’t questioned the police.

More than anything, we’re grateful to Daily Sun,” Charmaine said.
