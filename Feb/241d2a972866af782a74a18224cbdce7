THE parents of children who were expelled from their school have asked the department to intervene. This came after the pupils were expelled from Itumeleng Secondary School in Ledig Village outside Rustenburg, North West, for allegedly causing trouble. Josephine Kodisang said she wants the school to allow her son Refentse (20), a grade 10 pupil, to finish school and pass matric. “Children misbehave all the time. I have spoken to him about his behaviour and he hopes for better results once he is placed back in school,” said Josephine. She said she could not afford to have her son change schools. “It pains me that my child was treated like a criminal. Two teachers and the police came to our house at 1am to hand over a protection order, which restricts him from entering the school premises. How can a school matter be handled at 1am?” she asked. Another parent of a grade 9 pupil who was also expelled from school said it was frustrating to see other children going to school while her child was sitting at home.

North West education spokesman Elias Malindi dismissed the misinformation that the pupil had been expelled from school or served with a protection order. “We can confirm that the pupil was transferred to a TVET college upon request of a transfer letter,” he said. “The meetings were to discuss the pupil’s behaviour and misconduct in the school,” said Malindi.
