The South African Football Association (Safa) has appointed former Fifa referee Victor Gomes as chairperson of the National Referees Committee. Safa president Danny Jordaan confirmed the news during a national executive committee (NEC) meeting in Kempton Park on Friday. "I want to thank SAFA and especially the President for the trust entrusted on me with this appointment," said Gomes. "I will put same commitment in this job with the same professionalims I showed during my days as the referee,"he added sayingÂ implementing VAR was one of the several priorities which he wanted to get down to. Gomes retired soon after the FIFA World Cup in Qatar having achieved almost everything any elite referee can dream of. He handled the AFCON final between Senegal and Egypt in Cameroon before handling the CAF Champions League final between Al Ahly and Wydad AC at Stade Mohammed V in Casablanca in Morocco which the host club won 2-0. He was one of the few African referees appointed to officiate at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
