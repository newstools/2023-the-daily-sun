THIS madala has fingers of steel and it gets him free beer. The people buy beer for him so they can see the way he opens his beer quarts. Madala Vincent Shandukane (60) is known as the man with the steel fingers. Vincent from Chris Hani in Hammanskraal, Tshwane, simply uses his fingers to grab the bottle top and lift it up easily. “I love doing this and I don’t feel any pain. People are amazed when I do it. “After opening the bottle, I throw away the top and drink it with pride.” He said he doesn’t have many teeth to open the bottle so he uses his fingers. “My fingers are strong. What makes me happy is that I am drinking a lot of beer for free thanks to my finger skills.” He said a man tried to imitate him and injured his fingers. REGISTER TO COMMENT! “He stopped imitating me because he can’t be like me.” “People even think that it’s magic!” Vincent said he started drinking alcohol at the age of 22 and he has been cracking open bottle tops with his steel fingers for over 15 years. His friend, Mishack Mahlangu (55), said they drink beer together and he has seen his friend opening beer with his fingers. “It works for him because he doesn’t have teeth,” he said. Mishack said he has not seen anyone doing what Vincent does. “His fingers are strong, and this is helping him to drink beer for free.” Mishack said at first he didn’t believe it was happening and thought Vincent had some trick and was hiding something in his hands to open the beer. But now he realises his friend has an amazing talent. Mogapi Meno (49), who is also the madala’s friend, said: “My friend keeps on surprising people with his unique skill. I’m happy for him and it works like magic.”
