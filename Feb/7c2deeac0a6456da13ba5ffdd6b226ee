 NHLAMULO Tyres is the fastest growing company in Thulamahashe, Mpumalanga. The company is run by two brothers Ezekiel Mathebula (55) and Kaizer Mathebula (48), who have since hired three more workers due to an increasing number of customers. Their company specialises in fitting tyres, wheel balancing and alignment, car service and selling used tyres and brand-new ones at affordable rates. Ezekiel said they started the business in early 2021 after both of them lost their jobs due to retrenchment as a result of Covid-19 pandemic. "We started small, but the business is booming tremendously. Our busy days are Mondays and Wednesdays, and we are receiving big support and orders from various customers including taxi operators, trucks and ordinary motorists, especially females. Our prices are affordable. Our tyres fitment is R70, wheel balancing or alignment is R50, and car service stars from R250, depending on the vehicle," said Ezekiel.
