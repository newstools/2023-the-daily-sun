A TRAFFIC officer in Mpumalanga was killed on Monday afternoon, 6 February after being hit by a light delivery vehicle on the R544 between Emalahleni and Kriel. According to Mpumalanga Community Safety spokesman Moeti Mmusi, the traffic officer, who has been identified as Jeanette Mlangeni, was doing her routine law enforcement work when she noticed a light delivery vehicle driver who was allegedly overtaking dangerously. She then attempted to stop the vehicle. “She was hit by the same vehicle she was attempting to stop. The investigation into the crash is already underway,” he said. REGISTER TO COMMENT! Acting MEC Speedy Mashilo has since made a call on motorists to respect all law enforcement officers on the road, saying that they’re not on the road to make motorists’ lives difficult, but to save lives. “Although the incident is under investigation, we believe, with great caution on the part of motorists, such gruesomeness could have been avoided. Motorists must respect law enforcement officers and the rules of the road at all times. This will help in reducing road crashes,” Mashilo said.
