Another driver, who asked not to be named, said this had been happening for a long time. “We’ve had this problem since 2018. We went to many law enforcement agencies but were never helped. Now we want the government to intervene,” he said. He added that they wanted to work freely and as long as that did not happen, they would keep causing destruction on the road.

No injuries or damages were reported.
