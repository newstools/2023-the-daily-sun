When residents started questioning him, he told them he was carrying the carcass of his pit bull. When the residents forced him to open the bag, they made the shocking discovery. He was not asked to plead. He told the court he didn't need a lawyer and that he'd be able to handle his bail application. "I will conduct my own defence. I will also do my bail application," he said. Magistrate Phumeza Mthuyedwa reminded him of his rights several times but he insisted on representing himself. He also refused to be photographed in court by the media. Mthuyedwa advised Thwala to come prepared since he didn't have a lawyer. Nontobeko's emotional family member, Philile Sifunda, told Daily Sun they suspect Thwala wanted to delay the case. "The reason he wants to conduct his own defence is that he wants to stall the case and remain behind bars because he knows that if he gets good a lawyer, they will give him bail and his safety will be compromised. "He has caused us too much pain. What he did is unforgivable. We want him out. We want him to tell us why he killed her. We also want to know why he stuffed her body in a bag," she said.
