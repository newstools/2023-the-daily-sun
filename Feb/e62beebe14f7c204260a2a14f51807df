STELLENBOSCH FC has decided to retire Oshwin Andries’ jersey. “This is not a reaction to please anybody, but the greatest thing a football club can do when a player passes on,” said club CEO Rob Benadie on Tuesday night at a memorial service held at Rietenbosch Primary School in Cloetesville, Stellenbosch. “Number 25 will be retired,” he said. He announced that their young footballer of the year award will be known as the Oshwin Andries Young Footballer Award. Benadie said they have lost a star who was destined for greater football heights. He said he saw Oshwin for the first time when he went to see academy players and he identified him as an outstanding player. He likened his play to that of former Arsenal midfielder, Patrick Vieira.

He just went and bought it,” said Benadie. “He was a humble man who wanted to remain part of the community.”
