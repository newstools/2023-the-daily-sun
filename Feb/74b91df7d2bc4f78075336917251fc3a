TEN people have been arrested and appeared in Mamelsbury Magistrates Court on 15 February morning for allegedly defrauding Sassa. According to Hawks spokeswoman Warrant Officer Bonnie Nxumalo, Sassa lost over R1,8 million through their alleged criminal activities. Nxumalo said the investigations into the matter started last year in April. “It is alleged that individuals from Eastern Cape and Western Cape submitted fraudulent medical documents to apply for disability grants at Sassa offices in Malmesbury. They were allegedly assisted by one of the suspects who is neither a Sassa nor a health employee who ‘recruited’ these individuals at a fee. The fraudulent activities were conducted with the assistance of a Sassa employee,” said Nxumalo. She said the investigation is continuing and more arrests are imminent. Nxumalo said the Hawks team arrested 10 suspects aged between 27 and 58. They were arrested on 13 and 14 February respectively.

The period that Zulu referred to was from the 2012-2013 to 2021 to 2022 financial years. Zulu said this in Parliament in October 2022 after she was questioned by DA MP Bridget Masango.
