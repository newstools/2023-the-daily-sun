MATRIC top achiever Amukelo Nkuna has made her chief, Hosi Bohani Shigamani, proud. The 18-year-old from Shigamani High School was the top matriculant in Collins Chabane Municipality, Limpopo, and got a Bachelor’s pass with two distinctions. The chief celebrated Amukelo’s achievement by showering her with gifts and giving her money for her registration fee and to travel to Wits University in Joburg to study medicine. An excited Amukelo said: “As a matric class, we were not performing at our best but things changed when the chief and Full Gospel Pastor Vhelaphi Khoza visited us before our trial exams and encouraged us to study hard. “They told us to forget about teen pregnancy, drug abuse and things like that and we saw a great change afterwards. “Hosi Shigamani promised to help the top achiever with registration fees and transport.” Hosi Shigamani said he was happy with the school’s 2021 results but when marks started dropping in 2022, he and other partners knew they had to intervene. “Today, we are proud of this top achiever school, which got a pass rate of 84,8% and came first in the district,” he said. “Even Mayor Shadrack Maluleke was here to congratulate the school.
