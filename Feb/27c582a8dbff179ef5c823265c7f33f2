THE Stilfontein Magistrates Court postponed the case against 21 suspected illegal miners to 27 February, for further bail hearing for six of the suspects. One applicant took a stand in pleading with the court to grant him bail, and indicated that he was intending to plead not guilty to all charges. The state is opposing bail for all six. Two of the suspects are from Lesotho, one from Eswatini and three are South Africans. One accused is still out on R5 000 bail, while 14 others have not registered interest in applying for bail. North West National Prosecution Authority spokesman Henry Mamothame said the court appearance emanated from an operation on 10 October 2022, by the Hawks’ serious organised crime investigation. The unit was assisted by members of the Hawks’ tactical management section, special task force, national intervention unit, district illegal mining task team, tactical response team, Bidvest Protea Coin and Harmony Gold mine when it embarked on a raid at a mine shaft.
