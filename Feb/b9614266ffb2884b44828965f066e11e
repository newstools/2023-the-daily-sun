The house is now a shell after the man, who is in his 20s, removed the windows, doors and furniture. What is left is the roof.

They said the house used to be beautiful and neat, but the grass is now overgrown. “He is not always here and it is hard to find him,” said a resident. “It’s sad to see how drugs are destroying our kids. “This boy used to be likeable and neat, but look at him now.” Another resident said: “It’s not surprising that certain individuals are now taking the fight against drugs into their own hands because of the damage they have done to our youth. “We need to support the drug fighters because it is us residents who are seeing how our children are getting destroyed.” On 3 February, some members of Greater Benoni Concerned Residents appeared in the Daveyton Magistrates Court following the assault of an alleged druglord several weeks ago. The alleged druglord, who is now on the run, opened a case against them. The case will be back in court today, 15 February.
