PATROLLERS and security guards were deployed to the Geluksdal Secondary School in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni, on Tuesday, 7 February, to search pupils for dangerous weapons. They have so far confiscated 1 200 pairs of scissors and broken mirrors in pupils’ schoolbags. Head of the school patrollers in Ekurhuleni and Community Policing Forum member, Jomo Msimang, said Shawn Mphela (18) was stabbed with a pair of scissors outside the school premises last Thursday. “We are trying to prevent another incident like this one happening here,” said Msimang. “Most of the school kids might be having good intentions and are using these scissors for their school projects, but we’re afraid that some of them don’t,” said Msimang.

Msimang said they hope to create stability at the school. He showed Daily Sun pieces of the broken mirrors, which were often used when sniffing drugs. Pupils said they had scissors in their school bags because they use them in their school projects. Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona said the new security, which started working at the school recently, was there to ensure the safety of the pupils. Police were there to monitor the situation.
