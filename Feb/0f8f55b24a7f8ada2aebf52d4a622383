GATVOL parents stormed a primary school on Monday morning, 20 February and removed over 875 kids and 23 teachers from the premises. They demanded the removal of the principal of the school outside Dwarsloop in Mpumalanga, who they accuse of maladministration, fraud, nepotism and abuse of power. The principal was nowhere to be found and school circuit manager Oscar Nonyane urged to parents to allow him to report to work. Protesters, led by Desmond Mhlanga, Andy Ngwenya and Trevor Nkosi, refused. They handed over a memorandum of grievances addressed to the district education office and Education MEC Bonakele Majuba. Trevor said: “The principal and the SGB are corrupt. They couldn’t account for R120 000 from the National Lottery, which was meant for a sport facility. More than R100 000 won at a netball competition went missing.” Desmond said there were several break-ins during which the guard was tied up. REGISTER TO COMMENT! “During our investigations, we found that the principal had not reported some of the cases to cops and withdrew others without the parents’ knowledge,” he said. Andy said they suspected the SGB and the principal were stealing money.

The SGB chairman said: “We know nothing about the money from the National Lottery and the netball competition. We can’t confirm or deny the allegations.” Treasurer Eustence Mokone said they were struggling to get a pump for the JoJo tanks and a grass cutter. Mpumalanga education spokesman Jasper Zwane said: “The department has requested the District Office to submit a detailed report regarding the developments at this school. The department will upon receipt of the report from the district determine the cause of action to be undertaken.”
