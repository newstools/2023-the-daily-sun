PARENTS at a fee-paying school in Benoni, Ekurhuleni, locked the principal out on Monday, 13 February. Officials from the Gauteng education district had to intervene to ease tensions between the angry parents and principal. Parents said dagga was being sold like sweets inside the school premises, resulting in pupils being high during lessons. And, they blamed the principal for allegedly mismanaging funds and “lacking authority”. The parents also wanted the principal to explain what she had done with the money they said claimed disappeared from the school coffers. “We have been organising meetings but at the last minute, she would send a message to say that she was not coming,” said one parent. “She did this often, and we suspect she’s hiding something.” ALSO READ: Pupils march to court after stabbing! Parents said children were turning to drugs because there was nothing they could do. They said the school had enough funds to buy sports kit so their children could use facilities at the school. They further claimed she wanted to buy a grass cutting tractor for R250 000 when the school had no printing paper. “We have a tractor that needs R20 000 to fix, but she wants to buy a new one. “She doesn’t know how to prioritise,” said another parent. The angry parents claimed the school descended into chaos after she took over from the previous principal in 2021. “Teachers are said to be resigning because of her, and we want her out,” said a parent. They also complained about the condition of the classrooms.
