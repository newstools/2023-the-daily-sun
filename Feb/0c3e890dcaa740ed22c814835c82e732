GAUTENG police have arrested a man suspected of being the kingpin behind a vehicle crime cross-border syndicate. Colonel Mavela Masondo said law enforcement agencies worked together to identify and arrest a man suspected to be behind the theft and hijacking of high-calibre vehicles that were then taken to neighbouring countries. Masondo said the suspect was found with suspected stolen vehicles including a Ford Ranger, Mercedes-Benz C Class and Toyota Fortuner GD-6. He said on Thursday, 2 February, cops received a tip-off that the suspect would be at a shopping mall in Joburg, where he usually operated from. A team, comprising the Gauteng traffic police saturation unit, Bad Boyz Security, Tracker Connect, vision tactical security, Insurance Crime Bureau and Hollard Insurance, was mobilised.

He then went to a white Ford Ranger, also parked in the basement, and drove off with it. The team pounced on the suspect as he was about to exit the mall. Preliminary investigation revealed that the Ford Ranger was robbed from the owner in Alexandra and the Mercedes-Benz hijacked in Moffat View,” Masondo said in a statement. He added that the suspect led them to his residence, where a white Toyota Fortuner that was tampered with, was recovered. Multiple vehicle registration documents and passports were also seized. “The suspect was arrested and charged with possession of suspected stolen/hijacked vehicles. He is expected to appear in the Roodepoort Magistrates Court on Monday, 6 February. More suspects might be arrested pending further investigation,” Masondo added. Meanwhile, provincial commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela has ordered the police to conduct a thorough investigation and profile the suspect as he might be part of a bigger syndicate.
