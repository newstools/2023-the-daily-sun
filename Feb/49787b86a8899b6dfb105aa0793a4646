 The family of a missing elderly woman in Cokonyane village near Taung, North West said, hope the human skull and bones that were found in the veld in Modimong village belong to their mother, Kgalalelo Naledi (79). The police made a gruesome discovery of the skull and bones
in a grazing field last week Thursday 9 February 2023. On 13 February 2023,
bones and clothes that belong to Naledi were discovered in the same spot. The daughter of a missing woman, Patricia Naledi said: “It is true that the police discovered the human skull and feet bones last week Thursday. So, on Monday, they discovered my mother’s clothes and some bones. The forensic personnel has taken them away to run tests.  “My mother went missing almost four months ago and no one knew her whereabouts. She left the house and did not come back, so we searched for her everywhere with no luck.” Patricia further said, they even roped in sangomas for assistance. She added, however, all that was a futile exercise because what all those sangomas did was create confusion. “We have been in a difficult situation and prayed for her safe return. But, it seems all that did not work. Other sangomas said my mother has been killed, while others alleged that she is still alive,” she said.Meanwhile, the North West police spokeswoman, Col Adele Myburgh said: “I can confirm that an inquest case is under investigation by Taung Police Station. This comes after a human skull was found on 9 February 2023 in a grazing field in Modimong.

However, she said, the DNA results are awaited to confirm the identity.
