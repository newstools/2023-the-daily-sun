In this case, we refer to Motsepe Foundation Championship side All Stars FC who are set to lock horns against Orlando Pirates for their Nedbank Cup last 32 clash at Wits Stadium on Saturday night. Umlilo have been brewing hot and cold in the lower division with their inconsistent results, they are currently ranked sixth in the league and hoping to find a confidence booster with a win over the Buccaneers. However, All Stars have taken notes from the impressive comeback victory by Dondol Stars which saw them knocking out Matsatsantsa a Pitori will to advance to the next stage of the tournament. They believe that if the football Gods are behind them then they can also grab the bull by its horn. Stars coach Sinethemba Badela says that they have faith that they can upset Bucs, however, they still have to maintain some level of respect to the club as they are miles ahead of them. "Going into this game, it's a big game for us and they do not get bigger than this, when you get into the last 32 of this tournament, then you have an opportunity to play against some of the biggest and smallest club in the country," said Badela. "The next day after the draw, our dressing room was buzzing, the club has been excited about this fixture. When I look at our opponents, they are a well coached team with quality players. We did our analysis and we know their strengths and weaknesses. "We saw how Dondol Stars eliminated SuperSport and that gives us confidence, the fact that the Nedbank Cup offers such good stories about small clubs and their triumphs in this competition it give our players a little bit of motivation but we also have to prepare and play our best football on the day."
