WE witnessed an incredible Nedbank Cup last 32 games, an impressive start to the 2023 edition of the tournament which saw 50 goals being scored and 16 teams getting eliminated. While the remaining 16 teams have done well to book their spot in the next round from the previous week, they've have found out who their next opponents are. The Ke Yona Cup has managed to produce their famous David vs Goliath upsets and we're still going to see more action since the remaining lower division teams have been drawn against PSL giants. Giant Killers, Dondol Stars, will be looking forward to continue their giant killing spree when they meet AmaZulu in the next round. A feast of KZN derby between Golden Arrows and Royal AM. A repeat of 2022 finalist in a clash between Marumo Gallants vs Mamelodi Sundowns. On the other hand, Soweto giants in Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates have been drawn against second-tier clubs, Pirates will host Venda Football Academy while Chiefs faces Casric Stars. Third-tier side Mpheni Home Defenders will also fancy their chances against Chippa United. Thanks to Dondol Stars for knocking out SuperSport United in the first round, enhancing confidence to the lower division teams. The Last 16 draw has indeed produced mouthwatering fixtures as clubs look ahead to enhance their chances of winning silverware. Lower division clubs are still motivated by TS Galaxy triumph in 2019 and believe they stand a chance of walking away with R7 million price money at the end. Premiership giants will be looking forward to avoid embarrassment and finish the season with silverware. We are still going to witness exhilarating action, however, the date and times will be announced in due course.
