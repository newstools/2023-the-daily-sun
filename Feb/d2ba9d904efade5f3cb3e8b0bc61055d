Her message to young people is they must be wide awake. “Do not look down on other people’s jobs. Get yourself educated or qualified with skills then you won’t sleep hungry,” she said. “Self-belief is everything. What the next person thinks doesn’t matter.” She said she hopes that one day they will be able to train young people. “If we could get a grant it would help as there are many young people who come to us to learn,” she said.
