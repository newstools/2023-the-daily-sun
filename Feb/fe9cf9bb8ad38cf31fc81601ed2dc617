THERE seems to be no rest for eThekwini Mayor Mxolisi Kaunda. Minutes after the meeting that was meant to decide his future at the municipality was shelved, the auditor-general report came in. The city received an unqualified audit opinion for the 2021/2022 financial year, which raised alarms on the amount of water loss in the city. The report states that the city’s water loss has risen to 56,2% which means half the water they buy from Umgeni Water goes to waste. The report revealed that the city only sold 176 million kilolitres of the 401 million kilolitres it buys. The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the city welcomed the auditor-general’s report. The DA’s caucus leader Thabani Mthethwa said since 2018, the metro has continued to rack up billions in unauthorised spending.

Kaunda lived to see another week in the mayoral seat. The meeting that was to vote on a motion of no confidence against him was shelved after councillors wanted the process to be done when everyone is physical present in the chamber and not on a digital platform. Kaunda said they are pleased that the overall financial situation of the municipality remains sound and healthy. “The actual operating expenditure was below budget despite a substantial increase in bulk purchases,” he said. Commenting on the report, city manager Musa Mbhele said appropriate plans are being implemented to address consequence and contract management as well as performance information. “The municipality will also be investigating the material irregularities and will initiate processes for the recovery of any confirmed financial losses.”
