PRUDENCE Mswane wants people living with disabilities to have a bright future. She runs a disability centre that teaches skills to young people aged 17 and upwards. The 29-year-old said the KwaGuqa Disability Centre in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga, offered training in gardening, beadwork, catering, carpentry and welding. There were 45 people making use of the services. “People living with disabilities are still lagging behind when it comes to skill development. They’re not taken seriously and given enough chances to prove themselves,” she said. “Being disabled doesn’t mean you can’t do anything. The skills we give them here help them explore the employment market.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments Prudence told Daily Sun companies often hired people with disabilities. “Even the local municipality hires them, especially to work on Siyatentela projects,” she said. Prudence said the centre was trying to get sponsorships from big companies like Glencore. “The materials we use to train people come from sponsors. We cannot afford to buy them on our own. We also have teachers who volunteer part-time,” she said. Prudence said the centre asked for a small fee from the families of people who were being trained to buy food for breakfast and lunch. Thandeka Mashego (17) said since she started going to the centre, she believed she had a bright future. “I wish we could be taken more seriously as disabled people,” she said. Mxolisi Masilela (28) said there was nothing stopping him from achieving success. “I want to do things for myself and live a better life. The centre is helping me a great deal,” he said.
