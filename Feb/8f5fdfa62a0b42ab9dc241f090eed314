ABOUT 20 gunmen are still on the loose. This is because no arrests have been made in connection with the mass shooting that claimed the lives of four people at the notorious hostel in KwaMashu, north of Durban, yesterday. It’s still unclear what led to this mass shooting in this hostel that is known for crime and murders. But it’s suspected that it is gang related. Twenty armed suspects stormed the hostel in broad daylight and opened fire. Three people died on the scene while one died on arrival at a local clinic. Five others sustained injuries. Hostel dwellers are scared following this mass shooting.  One of the residents, who asked not to be named, told Daily Sun that because the suspects are still on the loose, they fear that there might be another shooting soon. “This is very bad and we are scared because you would find that these people who are wanted are still roaming around the hostel. And people who might know them will not say anything because they are scared,” said the resident. Another resident, who said he has been staying in the hostel for over 10 years, said this is not new and chances are that the killers will not be found. “Many people have lost their lives and no arrests were made. No one can blame the police because it’s not easy to find thugs here. This hostel is too congested and very dangerous. Even if people know who the killers are, they often keep quiet,” he said.

KZN police spokesman Colonel Robert Netshiunda confirmed that no arrests have been made yet, but said cops are working hard to find the suspects. He said the number of deaths is still four and five people were injured. “Murder cases are being investigated,” he said.
