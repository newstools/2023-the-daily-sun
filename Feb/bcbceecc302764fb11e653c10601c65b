A 43-YEAR-OLD police sergeant is among six suspects arrested for possession of a suspected stolen vehicle and two hijacked truck trailers in Clewer, Emalahleni, on Monday, 30 January. They’re expected to appear in the Emalahleni Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga on charges of hijacking and possession of suspect stolen property on Wednesday, 1 February. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the Middelburg flying squad members received information about the truck that was hijacked in Elsburg, Gauteng, earlier last month. “Members followed the signal which led them to a certain plot in Clewer, Emalahleni. “On their arrival, members noticed a White Toyota Dakar next to two trailers. Upon seeing the police, six people started running in different directions. Police managed to apprehend them, and out of the six people there was a police sergeant stationed at Vosman SAPS, as well as two Zimbabwean men,” said Mohlala. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! He said police further discovered that the trailers were still loaded with cooking oil estimated at R1,3 million and positively identified as the ones belonging to the hijacked truck. It was also established that the Toyota Dakar was reported stolen in Garsfontein, Gauteng, in September 2017. “The truck was also found abandoned a few kilometres from the plot. Police are continuing with the investigation to establish if the suspects are not involved in other similar crimes. Police will further engage the Department of Home Affairs to establish the status of the two foreign nationals in the country,” said Mohlala.
