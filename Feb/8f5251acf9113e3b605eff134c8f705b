THE City of Cape Town has warned the public about scammers who are impersonating Human Settlements MMC Malusi Booi. The scammers have created a social media page and a WhatsApp number with photos of the MMC, asking people to pay to get houses. "The accounts have been created by scammers and we have reported the profiles to the social media platforms. We ask residents to please be aware of scammers pretending to work for the city and not fall victim to their attempts," the city warned. The city said qualifying beneficiaries are registered on the Housing Needs Register at no cost. The city said the housing list is well-protected as it is also audited to prevent any queue jumping. It said people should not be fooled by scammers, promising to help them jump the queue.
