  PROCEEDINGS in former president Jacob Zuma’s private
prosecution case against the state prosecutor and a journalist, in the
Pietermaritzburg High Court, were very brief. This was because both advocate Billy Downer and Karyn
Maughan launched applications to review and set aside the summonses with which
they were served. Zuma’s private prosecution of Downer and News24 journalist
Maughan returned to court on Thursday, 2 February, after being served last
September. He claimed they breached the National Prosecuting Authority
Act when the state leaked a doctor’s note, filed with the court as part of
Zuma’s corruption trial with Maughan. Both Downer and Maughan launched applications to review and
set aside the summonses they were served with, with the applications set down
to be heard in March. Thursday’s proceedings were therefore expected to be brief,
and the case was predicted to be postponed pending the outcome of the
applications. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments And the former president was present in court. But this time
around, the courtroom was not full as only a few of his supporters and his
daughter, Duduzile Zuma, were among those who came. Outside the court it was
also quiet as there were no supporters present. Judge Nkosinathi Chili postponed the matter to 4 August. Jacob Zuma Foundation spokesman Mzwanele Manyi, who was also
not present in court, later posted: “The private prosecution of advocate Downer
and Maughan adjourned to 4 August pending their application to challenge the
summons (March). The judge in red robes issued a stern warning for the accused
to be present in person, failing which warrants of arrest will be issued.
