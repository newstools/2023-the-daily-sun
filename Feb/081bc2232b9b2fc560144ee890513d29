FOLLOWING his defeat as an ANC KZN deputy chairman nominee in the provincial conference last year and his removal as education MEC, Kwazi Mshengu has resigned as a Member of the Provincial Legislature (MPL). The provincial ANC accepted the resignation, stating that as an academic armed with LLB and Masters of Law, he was taking the decision to focus on practical court work. Provincial secretary Bheki Mtolo said as Mshengu was starting a new chapter, they were confident he would emulate late heroes and heroines of the struggle such as Griffiths and Victoria Mxenge, who dedicated their lives to using justice to drive and socioeconomic transformation. “As the ANC, we acknowledge the fact that the goals of access to justice have not yet been fully attained since democracy. Under a democratic government, we expect lawyers to perform the role of being watchdogs of democracy and being vigilant concerning the rule of law, as guaranteed by the Constitution,” he said.

Mtolo said they were confident Mshengu would ensure equal access to justice for the poor. “We have a responsibility to use this profession to rescue ordinary members of society from poverty. A lawyer is an important hand at the wheels of our economy, and custodian of the world of individual and professional liberty as well as of the public order.” Mshengu was also provincial Youth League chairman when he started as MEC in 2019 under Premier Sihle Zikalala. Last year during the provincial conference, he was contesting the position of the deputy chairman when he was defeated by Nomagugu Simelane-Zulu. He was then booted as MEC alongside Jomo Sibiya and Hlengiwe Mavimbela. He was replaced by Mbali Frazer.
