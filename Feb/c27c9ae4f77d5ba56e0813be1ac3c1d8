THESE gogos want their centre manager gone. They alleged that the 78-year-old centre manager was abusing the resources of Aganang Bagolo ba Simunye Centre in Westonaria near Mogale City. The gatvol gogos from Simunye near Bekkersdale in Mogale City claim the manager used the centre’s kombi to transport people from her church and that they were not benefitting. “She thinks this centre belongs to her,” said one of the gogos. On Monday, 6 February, they protested outside the centre demanding that she be fired. Aganang Bagolo ba Simunye board member and chairman Duma Ngcobo confirmed that they had received the complaint and the matter was under investigation. He said it was totally unacceptable.

The issue of food was raised the other day. We received complaints about her buying maize meal that was not fresh.” Ngcobo said they tried to communicate with the manager but she was apparently not co-operative. “We can’t fire her as we must first investigate. But we can assure the elderly that action will be taken.” Daily Sun spoke to the centre manager, who said all allegations against her were untrue. “I’m a friendly person towards the elderly. It’s unfair that they are complaining about my leadership, however, I’m waiting for the outcome of the investigation,” she said.
