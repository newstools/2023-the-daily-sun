This a great platform for women and I thought partaking in this would bring out a different side of me like entrepreneurial skills. It also gives you an opportunity to meet a lot of people and brands,” she said. She said she knows God wants to use her through this journey. “I’m in ministry. God has called me and I’m focused on that. I’m currently training as a pastor and this came a hard push from the Holy spirit because God will use me to spread His message. I also have a non-profit organisation that engages with communities that are underprivileged. This, for me, is the art of the ministry to be a reflection of God and do His work,” said Pearl. “God will align me in this competition and expose me to things I wouldn’t have been able to get by myself. He wouldn’t have let me enter if it wasn’t for His will. I might want to win the crown, but God might want me to do something else and save some people during this process,” she said.

It’s exciting to share this with other incredible women,” said the actress.
