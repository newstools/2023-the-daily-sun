FORMER Bafana Bafana striker Dino Ndlovu says the earthquake that hit 10 cities in Turkey has also affected some of his teammates as they lost loved ones. More than 33 000 people have been killed so far after devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria a week ago. Said Ndlovu: “I can’t say much but the situation is devastating. “My area is not affected at all. We are far away from affected cities. “I can relate to the Turkish people as most of my teammates have family members, and I also have a Turkish friend from Gaziantep who lost 13 loved ones and it’s sad.” The 32-year-old said that they resumed training yesterday with his Turkish First Division League club Boluspor, even though he doesn’t know when they will resume games as the league is still closed. The former Mamelodi Sundowns striker spent most of his career in Europe and this is his second spell in Turkey, having played for Kocaelispor. Said Ndlovu: “We were not training the whole of last week, but today (Monday) we’re back in training.” Ndlovu said they don’t have a lot of challenges where he stays in the city of Bolu, compared to those areas that are affected by the earthquake as it’s also difficult to get basic needs and petrol. “To be honest, I don’t know anything about that (lack of basic needs). Maybe the surrounding parts of the affected areas, but we are okay here and we also have petrol.” Ndlovu, who has now played for 12 clubs in Europe doesn’t see the reason to return home at this stage. “I am not closing any doors back home, but I am still enjoying my football here.”
