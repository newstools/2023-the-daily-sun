KHAYELIHLE Ndebele went to work as usual on Saturday, 11 February. And everything was normal until he came face to face with death. The 34-year-old man from Emaswazini Village in Mtubatuba, northern KZN, now believes his ancestors spared his life. He said he was on duty when heavy rain started pouring, and he decided to go home. While on his way, he saw a young woman walking and gave her a lift as she was walking in the same direction. And at the river, the water was above the bridge but he thought his bakkie would be able to cross. “My calculations let me down. While driving in the middle of the river, the engine went off and the car stopped,” he said. “I started panicking and the water started getting inside the car,” said Khayelihle.
