FREE STATE police arrested three men on Wednesday, 1 February after they were found in possession of boxes full of antiretrovirals (ARVs) in the Bayswater area. According to Lieutenant-Colonel Thabo Covane, cops received information about men who had boxes of ARVs in their possession at a mall on Kenneth Kaunda Road in Helicon Heights, Bloemfontein. Covane said the cops acted on the tip-off and pounced on the suspects at about 9.15am. “A silver bakkie with three men was searched in the mall parking area and boxes full of antiretroviral medications were found.

The value of the medicines recovered is estimated at R85 000,” Covane said in a statement. He said a preliminary investigation revealed that the ARVs were stolen during a break-in at a clinic in Boshof, adding that three suspects, aged 28, 43 and 52, were arrested. A case of possession of presumably stolen property was opened at Bayswater Police Station. The suspects are expected to appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court soon.
