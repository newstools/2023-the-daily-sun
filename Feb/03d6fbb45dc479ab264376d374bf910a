Apartheid Museum is among the properties disconnected by City Power for owing R1.8 million. On Tuesday, 21 February, City Power conducted another revenue collection drive in some parts of Joburg south, targeting electricity defaulters. Two business centres owing a total of R4.3 million, two mine equipment manufacturing companies owing a total of R1.3 million as well as the Apartheid Museum near Gold Reef City which owes R1.8 million were disconnected. The museum illustrates the rise and fall of apartheid with architectural firms and exhibitions. The City Power said the disconnected properties were issued with pre-disconnection notices months ago but failed to make payment arrangements. ALSO READ: City Power blasts non-paying landlords! "The objective of this operation is to improve the profitability performance and position of City Power so it’s able to continue to repair, and maintain its infrastructure and to provide essential services to the residents of Johannesburg. It’s important to reinforce the culture of paying for services that customers use in order for the entity to continue with day-to-day operations and to invest in implementing its future energy management strategies, " said City Power spokesman, Isaac Mangena in a statement. Mangena said there will be numerous outreach programmes within communities to assist with queries and payment arrangements, as well as to persuade defaulting customers to make payment arrangements in order to be spared from power supply restrictions. The City Power began its cut-off operation in October and is owed about R7.9 billion by customers across the city.
