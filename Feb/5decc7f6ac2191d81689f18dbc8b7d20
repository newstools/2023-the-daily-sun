ON FRIDAY, 17 February, Education MEC Matome Chiloane visited the family of a grade 11 pupil who died in a car accident. The MEC said he was dismayed by the accident that occurred last Monday, 13 February, when Nsovo Ndlovu of Protea Glen Secondary School in Soweto was killed in an accident involving her private school transport. According to the MEC, she was travelling in a Toyota Condor carrying 14 pupils. It’s believed the driver lost control of the vehicle after the car in front of him looked like it was turning but continued straight. This caused the vehicle to roll over. The other pupils in the vehicle were injured. Three were in a critical condition. During the visit to the family, the MEC promised to assist with the burial.
