SHE had a dream where she saw a crowd of people slaughtering a cow. When people told her it could mean death, she didn’t worry as no one in the family was sick but little did she know it would come true. Celiwe Mthoba (50) from Tsakane, Ekurhuleni, lost her son Mthokozisi Ngwenya (34) on 3 February, just a few days after she had a dream. He was shot dead and police are hunting for his killers. Residents told Daily Sun the killers wanted money from Mthokozisi. They said drug lords in the area hired young men to sell nyaope and if they did not bring back the money, they were killed. “From what we hear, we suspect Mthokozisi was killed for that. We want these people hunted down and arrested,” said a resident. “They know if they assault these boys, they will open cases so they kill them to destroy the evidence.” Mthokozisi’s family is worried that his killers won’t be arrested. His gogo Mirriam Radebe (74) said: “We pray that my grandson gets justice.” Celiwe said Mthokozisi’s death has left her heartbroken.

Celiwe said Mthokozisi had moved back in with her and his life started to improve as he was dressing neatly and taking care of himself. “People were even complimenting him for looking neat,” she said. Celiwe said she heard rumours that he was killed by drug lords. “It’s something I heard but can’t confirm it. We didn’t notice anything indicating he was involved with drug lords,” she said. His father, Muzi Ngwenya (54), said they were leaving the matter with the police. A case of murder was opened at Duduza Police Station.
