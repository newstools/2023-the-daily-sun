LIMPOPO co-operative governance, human settlements and traditional affairs MEC Basikopo Makamu said he is trusting in the multi-disciplinary rescue efforts of the provincial disaster management unit. Makamu is trusting them to see to the safe rescue of a man who has been stuck in the middle of the Letaba River in Tzaneen since Sunday. The man is reported to have been on a makeshift shelter on a tree since Sunday, 12 February but because of the recent consistent heavy rainfall in the province, the water levels rose, making it difficult for him to cross back to the riverbank. Makamu said the provincial search and rescue unit has been working tirelessly in an attempt to retrieve him, but efforts were cut short in the wee hours of this morning, 15 February, due to the violence of the current. “Our disaster management members have been collaborating with provincial SAPS (South African Police Service) and SANDF (South African National Defence Force) to dispatch a helicopter as the best intervention to get to him safely. We are, however, worried about his well-being as we believe he has been without food and water for multiple days,” he said. RGISTER TO COMMENT! The MEC said he is confident in the commitment of the brave men and women on the ground. He pleaded with residents of areas close to rivers and dams to avoid such masses of water, especially during this rainy season. “Two people have drowned in rivers in separate incidents in the province on Tuesday and their bodies were retrieved,” he said. “We again plead with our people to avoid flooded rivers. We are also aware that some of our people feel obliged to use these pools of water for religious reasons, but considering the clear fatal dangers at hand. We encourage you to postpone these activities,” he said. Limpopo is among the provinces that have been placed under the national state of disaster following the recent flooding that has swept across parts of the country.
