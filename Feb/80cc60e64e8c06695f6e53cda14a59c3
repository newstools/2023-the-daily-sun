THE decomposing body of an unknown woman was found in a man’s room on Friday, 17 February. Brigadier Selvy Mohlala said the body was discovered at the home of a 45-year-old man in Embalenhle extension 11, Mpumalanga, at about 11.30am. Mohlala said the man was already in custody as he was arrested for a domestic violence case on Wednesday, 15 February. “After the suspect’s arrest, his mother became worried as flies and a bad odour were coming from his room. She could not access the room as the suspect locked the door and took the key when he was arrested,” he said. Mohlala said the mum called the cops and a family member broke the door open. “That was when the shocking discovery was made. The woman’s decomposing body was lying on the bed covered in blankets,” he said. “She was only wearing a white T-shirt. The victim was light in complexion and her age is estimated to be between 25 and 30.” Mohlala said the woman could have been strangled as a shoelace was found around her neck.
