  BUILD One South Africa (BOSA) Leader Mmusi Maimane has opened a criminal case to legally force former Eskom CEO Andre De Ruyter, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and President Cyril Ramaphosa to reveal any and all on Eskom looting.He opened a case at Cape Town Police Station on Monday, 27 February.Maimane said the police needed to ensure the immoral and corrupt politicians siphoning money out of Eskom for themselves were investigated, prosecuted and when found guilty be sentenced to prison.Last week in a TV interview, De Ruyter alleged that that the ANC had treated Eskom as a feeding channel and that a certain minister was behind the looting at the power utility. Addressing the media, Maimane said De Ruyter was compelled to give evidence and name the cabinet ministers he has implicated in corruption at the struggling power utility.He said the explosive allegations by the outgoing CEO on TV act as prima facie evidence of corruption at Eskom implicating government, the ANC and power individual connected there to.

The first stop of which is to obtain and affidavit under oath from De Ruyter, to identity of the high-ranking politician and the identity of the cabinet minister,” said Maimane.He added that they must find processes in a Whistleblowers’ Protection Act that will allow De Ruyter to come.On Gordhan, Maimane said police needed to get a sworn affidavit from the minister confirming he was informed by De Ruyter, if he further raised the issue with the Cabinet and the President.Lastly, Maimane said Ramaphosa must also tell if his advisor informed him of these allegations, and when did he inform him, and what action did he take.Meanwhile, the ANC has given De Ruyter seven days to open case against the allegation he has made, or they will do so against him.ANC spokeswoman Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri said an active criminal case would allow law enforcement agencies to act by probing and possibly prosecuting any ANC member or public representative who may have been involved in the corruption activity. "We draw attention to the provisions of Section 34 of the Prevention and Combating Corrupt Activities Act, 2004, which makes it illegal for any person in authority not to report an act or information or corruption and criminality. To date, the ANC is unaware of any action taken by Mr De Ruyter in this respect. The ANC urges Mr De Ruyter to fulfil his constitutional and legal obligations to officially report to the police any act of criminality and illegality,” she said.
