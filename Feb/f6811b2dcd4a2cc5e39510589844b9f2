Cele was addressing members of the South African Police Service, Cape Town Metro police, South African National Defence Force, National Traffic Police and Western Cape Provincial Traffic Police who were deployed to keep order ahead of the 2023 State of the Nation Address (Sona). “We must make sure that today, anyone who chooses to break the law has chosen the wrong day,” said Cele, adding that their duty was to enforce the law. President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver his address at 7pm this evening at the Cape Town City Hall.

Operation Dudula member Nkululeko Watermeyer said they came to inform Ramaphosa that they wanted the migration law addressed. He further said the government was failing to fix the borders, allowing illegal migrants to enter the country and do criminal acts. “The crime rate has risen and it’s difficult for the police to arrest the perpetrators because they are unknown,” he said. South African Communist Party secretary general Solly Mapaila said there was a crisis of leadership. He said while they were having a crisis of energy in the country, energy companies were making billions of rand in profit. “The president needs to address the crises that are affecting the working class. They continue to suffer while companies are making profits off of them,” he said.
