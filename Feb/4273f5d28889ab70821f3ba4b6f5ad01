We just left things unattended because no one was saying anything. Even the cops didn’t get back to us,” she said. She said they also tried to request for footage from the filling station, but they were given a video that doesn’t play. “We went to the garage to request that the owner shows us footage and he said we must come with the cops and they would give it to us. We did that and we were given a memory stick. However, when I tried playing it on my laptop and on the TV, it didn’t play,” she said. “What’s funny is that the cops saw the video, but we can’t see it. But it is what it is,” she said.
