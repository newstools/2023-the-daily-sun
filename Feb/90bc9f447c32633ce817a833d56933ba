SIR Elton John is in town. But he is not here to perform. He came with members of the US Senate to oversee how Daveyton Main Clinic in Ekurhuleni is doing. Sir Elton John's Aids Foundation and the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Pepfar) are donating funds to help with the running of the HIV programmes at the clinic and other health facilities in the country. The visit was kept under the veil of secrecy and there was high police and private security presence. The officials from the national health department and Ekurhuleni district health were there to welcome them. Sir Elton John (75), a British singer and composer, didn't address the crowd but sat and listened to the speeches. After a short while, he was escorted out of the venue. Simon Choma, the chief director of the Ekurhuleni District's health services, said they're grateful for the support they received from Pepfar. "Pepfar has helped the department to establish mobile ARV clinics, and has supported us with core expertise in the fight against HIV," he said. He said Pepfar has donated about R8 billion to HIV programmes in Mzansi. Pepfar was initiated in 2003 to fight HIV across the world. The US government has invested over $100 billion (about R1,8 trillion) in the global HIV/Aids response, saving more than 20 million lives, preventing millions of HIV infections and supporting several countries including South Africa to control the epidemic. Staff members in charge of the HIV clinic at the health facility in Daveyton demonstrated to the high-profile visitors how funds contributed by Pepfar have to fight and control the disease. Dr Thato Chidarikire, director of HIV Prevention Programmes, also thanked Pepfar for the contribution they are making to helping countries to fight HIV.
