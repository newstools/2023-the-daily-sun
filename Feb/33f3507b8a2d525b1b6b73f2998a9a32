MPUMALANGA police are investigating four counts of murder after a mother was hacked to death with her pair of twin sons and her daughter in her house at Phola Park, Thandukukhanya in Piet Retief. According to Brigadier Selvy Mohlala, the gruesome discovery was made by the police on Friday, 24 February. This comes after family members of the deceased laid a complaint that they had made several attempts to get hold of the family members but failed. Mohlala said at about 10:25 pm, Piet Retief police immediately responded to the complaint and found the house locked. “They (police) had to force their entry into the house and were amazed by the discovery of a lifeless body in the kitchen. “When proceeding with the search, a 47-year-old woman's body, her 11-year-old son and her six-year-old daughter were found lying dead in one of the rooms," Mohlala said in a statement. He said an axe believed to have been used to kill them was also found in the same room. ALSO READ: Mayor angers residents!
