LEAVING his friends behind at the tavern did not seem like a bad idea at the time, but it was a decision he will regret for the rest of his life. The 37-year-old man from Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni, told Daily Sun that he will not rest until he finds the two men who raped him. He said he was at a groove on the night of Saturday, 4 February, but he felt tired and he had had too much to drink so he decided to go home. He stepped outside and was about to request a ride when two smiling men greeted him and asked where he was going. “They said they were going my way and offered me a lift,” he said. They seemed genuine and he agreed. “I got in without any hesitation. I didn’t give it much thought,” he said. He told Daily Sun they made conversation and he felt comfortable with them – until the car approached the bushes and one of the men took out a gun. “I thought it was a robbery but it was something worse than that,” he said.

He said he didn’t recognise either of them. He had never seen them before. The Gauteng police spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo, confirmed that a case of rape has been opened and was under investigation. No arrests have been made yet.
