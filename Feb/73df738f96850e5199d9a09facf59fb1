FOUR armed thugs stormed into a church in the early hours of Sunday morning, 19 February, to steal money. And when they did not find any, they stole all the music instruments. When the congregants arrived a few hours later to hold the service, they found their equipment worth about R100 000 gone. And the charismatic church in Springs, Ekurhuleni, was silenced. But now abazalwane said they are praying for the thugs to be caught and they're also hunting them. Church elder Mawonga Quintana said: "All we want is for the thugs to bring back what is not theirs. We sacrificed and saved money to buy the equipment, but they grabbed it just like that." The four thugs were wearing balaclavas, black security uniform and armed with two rifles as well as a pistol. They pointed guns at the caretaker, demanding he show them where the money was kept. The caretaker said they tied both his hands and feet up, and started ransacking the church office, but found nothing.
