THE mother of an injured 13-year-old pupil wants justice. The 41-year-old from Skierlik in Mamelodi, Tshwane, said her son was hit on the head with the butt of a gun. He was allegedly injured by a 15-year-old pupil from his school, Kutumela Molefi Primary in Mamelodi. The incident happened on Thursday, 23 February, near the school premises. The angry mum said her son was insulted for no reason and allegedly threatened with death. "The pupil tried to pull the trigger but luckily the carriage fell down. After that he used the back of the firearm to hit my son on the head," she said. "My son was badly injured and so much blood was flowing from his head, even his shirt was full of blood," she said.
