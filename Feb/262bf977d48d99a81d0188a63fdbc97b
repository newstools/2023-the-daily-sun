THE Office of the Public Protector has slammed Busisiwe Mkhwebane, saying she distorted information about legal fees owed to her lawyers. On Tuesday, 14 February, the office said Mkhwebane was informed in writing of arrangements to be made in respect to her legal fees at the start of the Section 194 Parliamentary Inquiry into her fitness to hold office. Acting spokesman Ndili Msoki said the office committed in principle to fund the reasonable costs of her defence. He said Mkhwebane and her legal team were advised that the office would ensure estimated costs were reasonable and budgeted for in accordance with regulations. Msoki said in June last year, Mkhwebane’s attorneys submitted an invoice for a significant sum in relation to high court matters between Mkhwebane, the Speaker of Parliament, the chairperson of the Section 194 Committee, and the president.
