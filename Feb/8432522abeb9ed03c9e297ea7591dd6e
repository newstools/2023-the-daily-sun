The couple have been together for almost three years. “We met when he came to my home at the informal settlement accompanying my clients who were coming to consult,” she said. “I was scared as I grew up thinking it was not normal for a black girl to marry a white man,” she said. “Now I know there is nothing wrong with marrying a white person because we are all human beings.” Mable said Tiaan fell in love with her after he saw her wearing the amadlozi clothes. “I’m grateful he chose me among all the beautiful women,” she said. “I love my husband. He is handsome, loving and caring.” Tiaan said: “We are grateful to the community for supporting us.” REGISTER TO COMMENT Reverend Nkosinathi Zwane of Victory Fellowship told the couple marriage was not a destination but a journey.
