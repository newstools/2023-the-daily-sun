ORLANDO Pirates new midfielder Makhehleni Makhaula is looking forward to experience his first Soweto derby. The Buccaneers lock horns against Kaizer Chiefs for their DStv Premiership clash at FNB Stadium on Saturday (3.30pm). Makhaula, who recently joined Bucs from AmaZulu on deadline day of the January transfer window, admitted that playing for Pirates and in the Soweto derby has always been his childhood dream. However, since derby day is edging closer, Makhaula told the media that he's nervous now that he has achieved his dream of playing for a big club in South Africa and he's about to play in the biggest game of his career at a 94 000  capacity stadium. "I'm a bit nervous, I've never played in front of 90 000 people. But I'm looking forward to it and I'm working each and every day at training. It’s going to be up to the coach (Jose Riveiro) who to select because I always raise my hand," said Makhaula. Due to his age (33), Makhaula's move to Bucs shocked many people and he wished the move could have come earlier in his career but he is happy that things turned out this way for him. "I wish this move to Pirates came a little bit earlier. My journey from Free State Stars, to Highlands Park, and AmaZulu wasn't easy. I had to fight for my place in the starting X1. Everything changed when I met coach Benni (McCarthy) at AmaZulu and I started becoming a regular starter and played my best football. "Coming to Pirates at 33 years old is a reward for the hard work I've put in over the years at my previous clubs. Even at Pirates I still have to earn my place because there are good midfielders at the club and healthy competition brings out the best in us."
