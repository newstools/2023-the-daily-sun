Sekhukhune United coach, Brandon Truter, has hit out at his players for their inconsistent performances and selective of matches. His outburst comes on the back of their 1-0 defeat against Cape Town City in their DStv Premiership match at Peter Mokaba Stadium on Saturday. The defeat has set back the Limpopo outfit in their mission to end this campaign in the top eight, but they dropped to seventh spot on the log with 27 points from 21 league matches. This was also Truter’s third defeat in nine league matches since he took over the helm from the fired Kaitano Tembo in December last year. The Citizens’ only goal of the match was scored by Thabo Nodada. “The result was not what we anticipated on Saturday,” said Truter. “This defeat is hard to swallow as we dominated the game, and at least, we could have got a point. "We dominated the game with ball possession but that did not win the game. "I think Cape Town City came looking for a point and they left with three. "They (City) only got one counter-attack and scored. I also think it was a case of mentality from our team.” He added: “I think the will to win a game was not there from us. I warned them (players) that if we want to win three or four games in a row we need to stop choosing games. "I also think a bit of consistency from the boys will be nice not blowing hot and cold. I am not happy with the results but we have to move on and look forward to the next game.” This result has seen Eric Tinkler’s lads move to sixth spot on the log with 29 points from 21 league matches. City face Maritzburg United in their next league encounter at Harry Gwala Stadium on Saturday (8pm) while Sekhukhune face Royal AM at Chatsworth Stadium the same day (6pm).
