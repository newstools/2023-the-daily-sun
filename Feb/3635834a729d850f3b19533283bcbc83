POLICE in Cape Town have released an identikit of a woman who stole a child at a liquor shop in Strand in December last year. Six-month-old Ivakele Yeko was stolen while a neighbour was looking after him. The 37-year-old neighbour said she left the child with a stranger as she went inside the liquor shop to buy some booze.  However when she came back, the stranger had left with Ivakele as well as her own daughter (7). Her daughter was later found on N2 close to her home.

"Police are appealing to anyone for information that could assist with the safe return of the baby and the arrest of the woman to contact the investigating officer Detective Sergeant Asanda Hlana on 082 301 8910 or alternatively the CrimeStop number on 08600 10111 or your nearest police station," said Sukwana.  Earlier this month, mother Asanda Yeko (22) said she has been devastated since her son went missing. "The time he was stolen he was wearing only a vest and a diaper. Whenever I eat food and sleep on my bed, I always ask myself where my son is and what he ate. I do not know whether he has clothes to wear. This issue is eating me inside," she said.

"They all say he is alive but when I ask where is he, nobody wants to explain. It hurts me so much," she said.
