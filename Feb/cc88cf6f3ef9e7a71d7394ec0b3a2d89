Polokwane City coach Duncan Lechesa was urgently rushed to the Milpark Hospital after feeling unwell on Monday, SunSport understands. It's believed that Lechesa had stomach pains and was taken to consult at a Polokwane hospital where he was treated and later transferred to Johannesburg. According to our informant, Lechesa was preparing for Rise and Shine's Motsepe Foundation Championship match against All Stars FC, which they won 2-1 to move two points clear at the top of the standings. City are now standing on 40 points, followed by Casric Stars with 38, and Cape Town Spurs are third with 37. Lechesa is believed to have missed the match against All Stars, a controversial game that left tongues wagging following decisions from match referees. Lechesa nearly gave Chippa United coach, Morgan Mammila, a heart attack when they took them pound-for-pound in the Nedbank Cup Last-32 a week ago, but the Chilli Boys survived to the Last-16 stage with a 3-2 penalties victory after a 1-1 deadlock. It is unclear at this stage when Lechesa will be released from the hospital as his club now enters a critical stage of their race to win the Championship and promotion back to the PSL. Next in their fixtures list are Hungry Lions, Magesi, and Free State based TTM."It happened so quickly, and no one thought the coach would be hospitalised for this long," said our informant. "But you could see that he was in great abdominal pain, and it was the right call to rush him to the hospital due to his serious medical condition. "Coach Lechesa is the best thing to have ever happened to Polokwane City since their demotion to the NFD. "And, now that he's about to complete the good work that he's started, then comes this."But I'm sure that he has all the support from club chairman Johnny Mogaladi who likes him a lot. "Lechesa's phone rang unanswered, and there was no one from the club who would speak on record about the coach's medical condition.
