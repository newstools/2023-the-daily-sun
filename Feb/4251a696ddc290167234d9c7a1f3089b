AS part of the World Cancer Day commemoration on 4 February, the South African Post Office has announced that people living with chronic illnesses can now collect their medication from 342 offices around the country. “The service is aimed at patients who live or work closer to a post office than a government clinic,” Johan Kruger, post office spokesman, told Daily Sun. “The main benefit of the service is longer service hours. Post offices will open until 5pm on weekdays and Saturdays until 12.30pm,” he said. “Waiting times have become shorter since the collection point for grants was moved to supermarkets. And most have seating available for customers who are unwell or elderly.” He said the 342 offices were selected because they complied with the requirements of the Department of Health. “Medication that requires specialised storage, such as cold storage, cannot be collected,” he said. He further said patients of government clinics who would like to collect their medication from their local post office should arrange it with their clinic. “The Department of Health sends the patient an SMS when the medication is ready for collection, and they have 14 days to collect it before it is returned,” he said. The collection service is not available in the Western Cape.

He said WHO had advised people to be on the look out for signs of cancer and visit a doctor or clinic when they saw them. These included inexplicable fatigue, a lump under the skin, sores that won’t heal, changes to existing moles and in bowel or bladder habits as well as persistent pain.
