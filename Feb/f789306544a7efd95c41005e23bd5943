ONE of the reasons why black pupils love Geluksdal Secondary School is the Afrikaans language. The majority of pupils said they like learning and speaking Afrikaans, and they wanted the Gauteng Department of Education to introduce the language to kasi schools. Geluksdal Secondary School is the only school in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni, that teaches this language. The overcrowded school has close to 2 000 pupils. The language was phased out in the kasi and rural schools in 1994. “If there was Afrikaans in our kasi schools there would not be murder in the school,” said one pupil (14), referring to the murder of Shawn Mphela. Shawn was stabbed to death on Thursday, 2 February, after a fight in a classroom over pepper spray. One of the pupils came with the spray and sprayed it, which led to a fight. The pupils who instigated the fight allegedly called members of an outside gang and they fatally stabbed Shawn. The youth of 1976 protested over the decision by the apartheid government to use Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in township schools, but pupils at Geluksdal secondary said they understood that history well.

It is one of our official languages,” said a pupil (15) Steve Mabona, spokesman for the Gauteng education department, said they would consider it.
