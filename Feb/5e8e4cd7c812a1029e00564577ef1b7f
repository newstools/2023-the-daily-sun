THE police have an idea who might have killed rapper Kiernan “AKA” Forbes, based on the video footage of the incident. Speaking at a media briefing for quarterly crime statistics alongside Police Minister Bheki Cele on Friday, 17 February, KZN commissioner Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi said they were still putting evidence together. “The identification of people seen on the videos is something we cannot disclose at the moment. But we have ideas about who they might be. We are continuing with the investigation,” he said. REGISTER TO COMMENT! Mkhwanazi added that they had collected a number of videos from different CCTV cameras to assist them. “We have not yet arrested anyone, but we have interviewed different people and obtained statements. We have also collected cellphones and are busy downloading some of them. We have also received our ballistic report from forensics, so there is still work the team is busy with,” he said. Cele said he did not attend to the crime scene because he was on call with Mkhwanazi and AKA’s family. The rapper was gunned down alongside his friend, Tebello “Tibz” Motsoane, outside a restaurant on Florida Road in Durban last Friday. He will be laid to rest today.
