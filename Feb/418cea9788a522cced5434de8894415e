THE EFF in KZN has vowed to continue disrupting KZN Premier Nomusa Dube-Ncube and her MECs to hold them accountable for their actions. This is after the EFF was thrown out from the KZN State of the Province Address (Sopa) last Friday when they refused to give Dube-Ncube a platform to speak, accusing her of being a liar. The party members were thrown out by the SAPS Tactical Response Team after accusing the premier of lying to the national assembly by telling the president that all KZN floods victims have been helped.

EFF KZN chairman Mongezi Thwala said that they'd like to confirm to the millions of EFF supporters and voters that it will not be business as usual. “We will not behave like all other political parties in parliament and submit to a suppressive decorum that rejects the views of ordinary citizens on the ground who want the Legislature to answer to their bread and butter issues which will change their lives. “We are putting it on record that whenever we see the fake and incompetent premier and all her clownish MECs, we are going to chase them together with the people of KZN because our people can no longer eat empty promises. “We know them for who they are, and we cannot die again. We died in Phoenix” he said. Thwala said that in mafia style of matured thugs, the speaker of the provincial Legislature called the Tactical Response Team to enter the chambers in an effort to silence a legitimate call to order of a lying premier of the province.

The SunTeam contacted the premier's spokesman, Lennox Mabaso, but he referred Daily Sun to ANC spokesman Mafika Mndebele. Mndebele said the ANC will have a comprehensive response on Wednesday but for now, they choose not to respond.
