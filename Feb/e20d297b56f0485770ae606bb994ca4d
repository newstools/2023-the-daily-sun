BOKGABO’S alleged killer’s appearance in court on Valentine’s Day will bring nothing but pain and rage for her family. The four-year-old Bokgabo Poo from Wattville in Ekurhuleni went missing on 10 October 2022 and her mutilated body was later found in the area. The little girl’s family is yet to get justice. The man who allegedly killed her is also facing a separate charge of rape and this has people questioning if there is any justice in Mzansi. He was in court for another rape case when he got bail. EVEN though her family wanted to bury her with the rest of her body parts, unfortunately they couldn't. On Monday, 7 November family, friends and residents of Wattville in Ekurhuleni bid farewell to four-year-old Bokgabo Poo whose body was found mutilated last month.  Bokgabo’s family believes that if he had remained in police custody, their bundle of joy would still be alive. Tomorrow, the suspect Ntokozo Zikhali is expected to appear before the Benoni Magistrates Court on charges of murder, kidnapping, rape, defeating the ends of justice and the violation of a corpse. Bokgabo’s father Irvin Ndlovu took to social media to express how broken he is. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments He emphasised that his child’s death won’t be in vain. He said if the law fails him, he will deal with the suspect. “Tomorrow, 14 February 2023, I will not give nor receive roses. I will not be in a red room full of love and candles. I will not exchange gifts or have any desire for love-making. I am reeling from a bad dream where I can’t even scream. When they pop champagnes and unwrap gifts of love and chocolates, I will be sobbing, filled with rage and pain as I will be facing my daughter’s murderer in court,” said Ndlovu. “I can promise you one thing, her death will not be in vain. I’ve already surrendered myself to death or imprisonment in a quest for her justice. I will meet you in hell, bro,” he said.
