AFTER hearing that the woman who is allegedly the reason her daughter was doused with acid abandoned bail, Jabu Thabethe was happy. The 35-year-old mum told Daily Sun this shows that the woman knows what she did was wrong and the only place she belongs is in jail. Londi Thabethe (18) was doused with acid by two girls she was fighting with in her area. The mother of the two girls, Bongekile Masikane (46), got involved in the fight as she allegedly gave the two girls acid. It's alleged she ordered her daughters to pour it over Londi. "At least she abandoned bail, although that will not change what she did but now we can focus on getting my daughter healed. Although she might never look the same as she was, I just want her to heal," she said. Bongekile was arrested and appeared in the KwaDukuza Magistrates Court on Wednesday, 23 February. She was supposed to apply for bail but abandoned it. She is facing two counts of attempted murder. Outside court, different political parties and residents were protesting and shouting that Bongekile shouldn't get bail. ALSO READ: Gogo (83) burnt and killed for R36! One of the residents, Nhlakanipho Mkhize (23), said a person who could do such a terrible thing to a young girl doesn't deserve to be released. "I'm happy that she decided to abandon bail. This was a good decision," he said. Meanwhile, Londi is still in hospital recovering from the acid wounds. Her face and upper body are burnt and she might never look the same again.
