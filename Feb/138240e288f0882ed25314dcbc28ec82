THE hand that gives is more blessed than the hand that receives. Pastor Jabulile Skosana takes that passage from the Bible seriously. Every Tuesday and Friday, he goes out onto the streets and finds nyaope addicts that he takes to the KwaGuqa Disability Centre in Emalahleni so that he can feed them. Skosana started the initiative in December. He works with Thando Masango from the Ikakarambha Foundation and they pay from their own pockets to buy the food. “These addicts are human beings. They need to be treated like every human being and be given help,” he said. “I’m lucky that my wife is willing to cook for them twice a week with the help of volunteers.” Later in the afternoon they call them to come and eat.

After counselling they have church service where the addicts get spiritual healing. “We believe they are fighting demons,” he said. Masango, who is a former drug addict, told the SunTeam that he knows the hardship of living on the streets without anything to eat. “I have been there. I know all the struggles of being a drug addict. I have partnered with the pastor in order to help our brothers,” he said. “Our aim is to rehabilitate them since we only have two rehab centres in the province.” Addicts Sipho Mavuso (33) and Themba Mtshali (37) said they were willing to change. Themba said: “We appreciate what the pastor and Thando are doing for us. “Nobody wants us in the community but they are showing us some love.” He said he is in the process of giving up smoking. “Coming here helps me a great deal. Gradually I will reach my goal,” he said. The pastor said they need sponsors to help them continue with feeding the addicts.
