Patrick Nyame’s brilliance between the sticks contributed to Royal AM knocking Cape Town City FC out of the Nedbank Cup Last-32 stage with a 4-3 penalty shoot-out victory at DHL Stadium on Sunday night. The hosts, Cape Town City, were desperate to win the game having lost their last two Premiership games ahead of this tie against Thwihli Thwahla. On the other hand, the visitors in Royal AM were coming back from a convincing league win and wanted to maintain consistency under the tutelage of coach John Maduka. This was Maduka’s second game in his second stint with the Durban-based side. Nyame produced brilliant saves,  forcing the game to end in a goalless draw. He continued with his brilliant performance in the penalty shoot-out to help send Thwihli Thwahla to the next stage of the tournament – the 15th side through to the Last-16. The winner between Polokwane City and Chippa United who clash on Valentine’s Day tomorrow at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane will conclude the 16 teams. Royal AM showed early signs and determination to win with striker, Tebogo Potsane close to braking the deadlock after 25 minutes played, but his flamboyant strike was denied by the woodwork. Mduduzi Mdantsane, Lyle Lakay, Brice Ambina all converted for City, while, Lorenzo Gordinho and Khanyisa Mayo missed their shots. On the other hand, Ruzaigh Gamilden, Mokete Mogaila, Samuel Manganyi, Sedwyn George converted to send Royal AM through.
