A FREE State High Court judge is in hot water for charges of theft, money laundering and contempt of court. According to Brigadier Thandi Mbambo, on Friday, 17 February, the judge was served with a (J175) summons as a form of securing the attendance of an accused person in court by the Hawks. Mbambo said the investigation came after a Road Accident Fund (RAF) claim was made when the judge was still practising as an attorney. “The claim was made on behalf of a six-year-old child who was involved in an accident in 2000. He handed over the client’s file with an amount of R1 255 000 to another attorney, upon taking up appointment as a judge,” Mbambo said in a statement. REGISTER TO COMMENT!

Hawks national head Lieutenant-General Godfrey Lebeya has applauded the investigating team for its scrupulous investigation. “We will not leave any stone unturned in protecting the rights of vulnerable persons,” Lebeya said.
