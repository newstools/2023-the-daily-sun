UNDER spending by municipalities not only leads to the loss of allocated money, but it’s also a loss of an opportunity to develop cities. This is one of the reasons Limpopo Treasury MEC Seaparo Sekoati has called on all 27 municipalities in the province to plan differently to break the cycle of poor performance. In the 2021/2022 financial year, the auditor-general’s report showed that some municipalities remained stagnant for more than five years. This is because some were found to be below 30% of expected performance.

Sekoati said there should be consequences for underperformance. “There should be accountability for every government document that is lost because it derails us from improving our municipalities,” he said. He said the municipalities should be able to respond urgently to community needs and avoid community unrest as this drags them backwards. “Political leaders should be involved in planning and not leave everything to officials,” he said. His advice to municipalities that are not doing well is to consult with those that have improved.
