OVER 300 security officers were left high and dry after their employer failed to pay them. The guards were hired by Falaz Protection Services for the match between Kaizer Chiefs and Royal AM at a DStv Soccer League match at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane, Limpopo, on Sunday, 29 January. They were promised they would be paid R200 after the match but when it ended, no one from the security company could be found. They said they were forced to sleep outside the stadium in heavy rainon empty stomachs, hoping the company would bring their money. A 26-year-old guard said they usually got paid after a match. “We don’t know what happened on Sunday,” she said. On Monday, the angry officers protested outside the stadium. to demand their money. A 30-year-old guard said: “We had to sleep outside the stadium as we had no money to get home. This kind of treatment is unacceptable, considering that we are poor and need the money.” Polokwane Mayor John Mpe intervened, saying: “Now we have to take over the responsibility of the service provider and pay the workers. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! “We will take action against the service provider.” The security company released a media statement apologising for what happened.
