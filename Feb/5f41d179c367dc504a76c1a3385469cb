Juliette told BBC that she was planning to invest some of the money to fulfil her dream of becoming a doctor without worrying about loans. “Once school is done, my family and I will pick a continent and start exploring. I want to experience different countries, study their history and culture, try their food and listen to their language,” Juliette added.
