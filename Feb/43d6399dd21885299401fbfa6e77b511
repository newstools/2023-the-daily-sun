Chiefs will be looking forward to enhance their chances of ending a
eight-seasons trophy drought when they face Maritzburg United in their Nedbank
Cup last 32 clash at Harry Gwala Stadium on Friday night. Zwane,
who is under pressure of delivering silverware for the club, and with so much
expectations from the impatient fans makes it difficult for him to get the job
done, but he trusts his charges to grind for results. Chiefs
are going through an injury crisis and missing some of their key players in the
likes of Nkosingiphile Ngcobo, however, the 46-year-old coach believes they
have quality players in their squad depth and can get the job done on
Friday. As
much as he is under pressure, Zwane reckons his charges are focusing on the
game and working hard in their preparations to go out there and make the
Amakhosi faithful proud and give them hope to end the trophy drought
sooner. "We
have been working hard to prepare for this game and we are still going to put
in more work during the work because we want to go there and win," he
said. "Our
players have been doing very well, it's just a matter of time for us to get it
right, and we will get it right sooner starting with our game on Friday. "It's
not going to be an easy game, but we are going there with one thing in mind,
which is to win grind for results and make sure that we go into the next round,
Maritzburg United are a very good team, we will have to fight very hard to go
through."
