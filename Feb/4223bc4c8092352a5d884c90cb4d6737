THE City of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality and some security companies seem to be pointing fingers at each other while workers are waiting for their salaries. Security guards from Khayalami, Ngodvo Ngodvo and Zabalaza, funnelled to the OR Tambo Government Precinct, are demanding answers from the municipality as to when are they’ll be getting paid. And, they have subpoenaed MMC and Speaker of Ekurhuleni Raymond Dhlamini to give them what they want. According to Pontsho Ngobeni, a worker at Ngodvo Ngodvo, after making queries, they were told that companies would not pay them. “When we call the municipal office, we get told it has paid companies, but those companies claim they have not done so. And, it is obvious that three or four companies cannot claim one story. We have kids to feed and bills to pay,” said Ngobeni. Rose Shirinda, also from Ngodvo Ngodvo, said she had to take out a loan to bury her husband because her funeral cover lapsed while she was waiting to get paid. REGISTER TO COMMENT! “I had to bury my husband on a loan because I had no money,” she said. Many other workers also said they needed to pay their bills and feed their children. Deputy chief of police Ndumiso Qcwabe, with Toka Lekitlane (Zabalaza) and Sandile Shabangu (Ngodvo Ngodvo), came to address their concerns. “As the municipality, we need to take responsibility for this problem. It was within our internal admin processes, so don’t take the blame out on these companies but on us,’’ said Qcwabe. He said that the finance department could not process salaries because of some discrepancies, caused by them. Therefore, they would be corrected and submitted on Thursday so that by Friday, workers will get paid. “Money cannot be processed immediately as we only discovered now that we have a problem with the dates on invoices. We have to get the dates right and submit them accordingly,’’ he said.
