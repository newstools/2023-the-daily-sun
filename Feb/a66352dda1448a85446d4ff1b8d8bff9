THE Parliament Portfolio Committee on Police wants to tackle the rampant crime levels in Mzansi. It has urged the Civilian Secretariat for Police Service together with the senior management of the South African Police Service (SAPS) to enhance collaborations aimed at finding workable solutions. The committee interrogated the third quarter crime statistics which were released last week by Police Minister Bheki Cele. Chairwoman of the committee Tina Joemat-Pettersson said they remained concerned by the upward trend in contact crimes. She called for a paradigm shift if the country is to overcome this problem.

All these indications point to a need to change gear and find workable solutions,” she said. Joemat-Pettersson said they welcome the assurance that about 10 000 police officers will be recruited and trained for the coming financial year. ""Also, the capacitation of the detectives’ services by 1 094 officers is a welcomed intervention which will improve the likelihood to resolve acts of crime,” she said. Joemat-Pettersson said they have also noted the growing concerns around the escalating cross border-related crimes. She said the minister of police and the senior management of the SAPS are already engaging with their counterparts in neighbouring countries to stop the tide of crime across borders. “We need all the expertise we can get in streamlining our efforts to ensure safety and security in the country. A safe South Africa will unlock economic potential of the country, a critical requirement to fight unemployment, inequality and poverty,” she said.
