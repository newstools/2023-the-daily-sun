Chiloane said it hurts to visit families every week because of painful incidents.  "Parents send their kids to school hoping they will be safe," he said.  According to Chiloane, the department will increase security that is needed at schools.  “We will make sure that learning starts on time and teachers are in class all the time. We are going to make sure that from now on we protect and secure schools in the province, especially the hotspot ones.  “We need to ensure we provide every necessary protection we can for these learners. It must be known that schools are not playgrounds for gangsterism and it also requires community members to come back here and protect the school,” said Chiloane.
