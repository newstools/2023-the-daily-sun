BANYANA Banyana coach Desiree Ellis says their trip to Turkey was "worthwhile" building experience in preparing for the 2023 Fifa Women's World Cup. The world showpiece will be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand and played between 20 July and 20 August. Banyana played two friendly matches in Turkey where they beat Uzbekistan 3-0 and drew 1-1 against Slovenia on Tuesday as part of their World Cup preparations. The win over Uzbekistan was Banyana's first since winning their maiden Women's Africa Cup of Nations title after beating hosts Morocco 2-1 last August. The second match against Slovenia was more challenging as they had to come from behind to earn a draw. Ellis said the game against Slovenia provided good preparation for the global showpiece. "The technical ability of Slovenia was really good, their one and two-touch football was good and we know Sweden and Italy play a similar game," said Ellis.
