THEY believe they sold their souls to the devil when they started smoking nyaope. But the nyaope addicts from Ackerville in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga, are now asking for help to quit smoking. They said they are tired of living like zombies and want to go to rehab so they can fulfil the dreams they had before they were hooked on drugs. Godfrey Motau (31) told Daily Sun that drugs are the worst demons of all demons. He said he and his friends no longer want to smoke, but it’s difficult for them to stop on their own. He said he has been smoking drugs for 18 years now. “Drugs landed me in jail twice for stealing cables and steel. My mother died in 2010 with a broken heart,” he said. Bongani Nkosi (41) said he had a good life and well-paying job, but being hooked on drugs ruined everything. “On pay day, I would spend half of my salary on drugs and sex workers. I would then spend the rest in a few days. I wish I could turn back the hands of time,” he said. Philani Nkosi (35) said he blew R529 000 in one month on drugs in 2010. He said the money was a payout from the Road Accident Fund after his brother was knocked down by a car in Joburg. “Blowing all that money on drugs is still haunting me,” he said. The addicts said they are hooked on drugs including nyaope and rock. Thando Masango from Ikakarambha Foundation said quitting drugs comes from the heart. He said there were only two rehab centres in the province that catered for 100 people.

Quitting is possible,” he said. A pastor said it was encouraging to see drug addicts seeking for help. He said: “I urge the parents to help them irrespective of how they hurt them in the past. “They should be taken to counselling and I hope social workers can refer the addicts to relevant departments for help.”
