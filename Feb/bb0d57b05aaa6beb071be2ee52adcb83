ORLANDO Pirates brushed aside Motsepe Foundation Championship side All Stars 2-0 to book their spot in the Nedbank Cup last-16 on Saturday night at Wits Stadium. Monnapule Saleng and Thembinkosi Lorch scored the goals in the second half of the match to book their tickets to the next round. Lorch, who was introduced in the second half of the match, was playing his first match following a five months absence. Lorch suffered a knee injury and has not played since August last year. However, on his return on Saturday night, the 29-year-old proved that he still got the mojo, scoring Pirates' second goal. The two sides played to a goalless draw in the first half of the match despite creating numerous chances in the wet conditions. Pirates' experience came in handy in the second stanza of the game, and they were able to find holes in All Stars' defence. Pirates gave Makhehlene Makhaula his debut coming from the bench in the last five minutes of the match to replace Miguel Timm. All-Stars coach Sinethemba Badela said he was proud of his players despite losing the match. "We did well in the first 60 minutes but after scoring the goal it became a problem. But I cannot fault my players I though they gave their best on the night," said Badela.
