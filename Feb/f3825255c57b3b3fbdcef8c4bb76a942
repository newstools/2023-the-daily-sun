AN ALLEGED child rapist was released on free bail on Thursday, 9 February, enraging the victim’s family. The 60-year-old man from Sun Valley in Mabopane, Tshwane, who is living with a disability, will be back in the Ga-Rankuwa Magistrates Court on 24 March. Residents, parents and family members of the eight-year-old victim said they wanted him to be kept in jail. The child’s mum (40) said she found out from her neighbour that the madala had been raping her daughter since November last year. “From the way people are talking, he has been raping kids in our area for months. “My daughter has been losing weight and I’m worried,” she told Daily Sun. MADALA PHILLEMON had been dead for a year and it was time to celebrate his life with a tombstone. But nothing could have prepared the Masedi family for what they found when they went to the grave. A HOLE HAD BEEN DUG AT THE GRAVESITE, THE COFFIN HAD BEEN OPENED AND THE BODY WAS GONE!  The neighbour (29) said the child told her about the rape. “When I heard of it in December, I told her to tell her mother, who did not take it seriously until it happened again,” she said. Another mother (33), whose nine-year-old daughter was also an alleged victim, said the madala lured kids with money and sweets. “My daughter said the madala sent her to the shop one day and asked her to put the money in her private part. The next time around, he pulled her dress up and said one day, he would put his penis inside her,” she said. The mother said she tried to open a case, but the police would not help because her child was molested and not raped. Kedibone Sesoko (51) from the community policing forum said she was angry.
