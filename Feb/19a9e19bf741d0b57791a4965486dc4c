A WOMAN has been arrested for allegedly forcing her 11-year-old niece to open a false rape case. Gauteng police spokeswoman Colonel Dimakatso Sello said the police viewed the opening of false cases in a serious light as it had an impact on state resources, which could be directed towards real emergencies. The 57-year-old from Mamelodi, Tshwane, has been charged with perjury. “Perjury is a criminal offence which is punishable by law,” said Sello. She said members of the Mamelodi sexual offences unit arrested the woman on Thursday, 16 February. She said it was alleged that the woman forced the girl to open a false rape case against her stepfather in 2021. “The stepfather was then arrested and appeared before court. However, further investigation revealed that the niece was influenced by her aunt to falsely accuse her stepfather of raping her,” said Sello.
