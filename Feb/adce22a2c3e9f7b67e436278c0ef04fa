 RAPPER Kiernan "AKA" Forbes' death has not only affected his family and close friends, but even young people across Mzansi. Young artist Koketso Waleng paid homage to the late slain musician by drawing sketches in his honour. Her parents, Given Waleng and Pheaha Waleng, told Daily Sun Koketso was a big fan of AKA and always sang along to his music. They said after hearing the news of his murder on 10 February, their youngest daughter was devastated. The 13-year-old from Joburg asked them why people would do such a cruel thing to her idol. Her mum Given said: "She is doing grade 8 and she really loved the rapper. She's been sad recently as she loved him." ALSO READ : Ukhozi FM presenter's MERC 'taken' by Repo men! "We were touched by the passing of AKA as a family. She then decided to draw him as a tribute,” Given said. "As parents, we are very amazed by her talent as she is self-taught.
