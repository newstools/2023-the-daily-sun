WATER and electricity cuts are causing delays in several courts in Mpumalanga. The cases at Mkhuhlu, Acornhoek, Bushbuckridge and Mhala magistrates courts are often delayed or postponed due load shedding or water supply disruptions. On Tuesday, 22 February, the Bushbuckridge Magistrates Court had no water or lights. The double pain forced the court to postpone all cases. This was because all their toilets, including those in the holding cells with awaiting trial prisoners, couldn't flush as they didn't have a single drop of water.

We have spent too much money traveling from Casteel for court since January. But the court keeps postponing the matter as their recording machine is not functioning because of lack of electricity and the toilets are locked because there's no water," said a witness. Ministry of Justice and Correctional Services spokesman Chrispin Phiri said: "These are very concerning occurrences across various communities. The courts are at the heart of these communities, so they are not exempt from these infrastructural challenges. The infrastructural challenges have direct impact on the justice system and delay the administration of justice."
