THE ANC has welcomed SA Rugby’s decision to withdraw an invitation for the Israeli-based Tel Aviv Heat to play in the Mzansi Challenge rugby tournament. The governing party said in a statement on Monday, 6 February, that they hoped the decision would serve as a reminder to Israel that its illegal occupation of the Palestinian land was an injustice that should not be tolerated. “The ANC continues to call on all progressive forces of the world to continue putting pressure on Israel to go back to a peaceful dialogue around the two states’ solution and ultimately end one of the most protracted conflicts in the Middle East,” said the ANC.

SA Rugby announced on Friday that it had withdrawn an invitation to Tel Aviv Heat to compete in a second-tier competition from 24 March. A Mexican side could replace the Israelis. Other teams will come from Spain, Kenya, Namibia and Zimbabwe, as well as six South African sides. SA Rugby president Mark Alexander said the decision was taken after the organisation listened to the opinions of important stakeholder groups. “We have taken this decision to avoid the likelihood of the competition becoming a source of division, notwithstanding the fact that Israel is a full member of World Rugby and the IOC (International Olympic Committee),” said Alexander.
