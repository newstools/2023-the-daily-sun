PARENTS and pupils have complained that their classrooms are overcrowded and they can’t focus. In response, DA education spokesman for Gauteng Khume Ramulifho conducted an unannounced oversight inspection of three schools in Soshanguve, Tshwane, on Tuesday, 7 February. He visited MJ Midi and Botse Botse secondary schools and Thorntree Primary School. He said township schools should copy former Model C schools and demand a meeting with the Gauteng Department Education before admitting more pupils. Ramulifho said the situation at Thorntree was so severe that 77 pupils were in one mobile classroom. “This environment is not acceptable as it deprives pupils of access to quality basic education. The mobile classrooms are old and dilapidated,” he said. “Many of the ablution facilities are not functioning, forcing pupils to use an open field next to the school to relieve themselves.” Ramulifho said it’s clear that the education department is failing to properly allocate resources. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments “The governing bodies at former Model C schools set their conditions beforehand. If you want us to take in more pupils, you give us the resources we want,” he said. “We will further write to the education MEC to seek a permanent solution to the unhygienic and non-functioning ablution facilities at both Thorntree Primary School and Botse Botse Secondary School.”
