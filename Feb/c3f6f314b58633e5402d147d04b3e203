TWO men were arrested by the Joburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) officers for assaulting a cop at Bara Taxi Rank in Diepkloof, Soweto. JMPD spokesman Xolani Fihla said on Thursday, 9 February, officers joined Environmental Health inspectors who were checking compliance at shops at the tank. While doing so, an officer was approached by two men who were intoxicated and trying to get his attention. “The officer ignored the two and when they realised that he was not interested, they confronted and started to push him. In defence he retaliated, and the two started slapping him. A back-up was summoned and upon arrival, the two fled the scene on foot,” Fihla said in a statement. REGISTER TO COMMENT! He added that officers gave chase and apprehended them on Collinder Road. They were arrested and detained at Diepkloof Police Station. JMPD acting chief of police Angie Mokasi has condemned the attack. “It is unacceptable that officers continue to be attacked while they are carrying out their duties,” said Mokasi.
