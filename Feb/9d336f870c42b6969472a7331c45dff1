IN pictures shared with Daily Sun, destitute mothers and children are seen sleeping on chairs and some on the floor. Next to them lie their personal belongings. They have been evicted from their homes in the George Goch Barracks by cops from Jeppe Police Station, who want the space for newly-recruited police officers. Some of the resident insist that they did not invade the space illegally. They said they were taken there by cops that they knew. Evicted tenant Thobile Rhadebe (42) said: “This is a nightmare. I’m homeless. I have been sleeping in the passage since the eviction.” Thobile said she has taken her children to her friend’s place at a hostel nearby.
