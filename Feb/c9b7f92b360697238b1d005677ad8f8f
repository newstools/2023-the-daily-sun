REABETSWE Khambule was in labour and headed to the clinic for help. But nurses allegedly told her they were on a lunch break and would help her when they were done eating. So she gave birth on the floor on her own. She said when she got to Sharpeville Clinic on Tuesday, 7 February, she was told she is three centimetres dilated. “After I gave birth, nurses shouted at me asking what I drank to make me give birth early,” she said. Reabetswe’s mum, Zodwa Khubeka (38), said she left her daughter at the clinic. When she returned, she found her daughter in an ambulance. “When I asked nurses what was happening, they told me doctors at Sebokeng Hospital will answer all my questions. “I then followed the ambulance to the hospital where I was refused access to my grandchild,” she said. Zodwa said her daughter told her she had pain and called for help. “They didn’t respond and she went to them to tell them she was in pain. The nurses told her to go back to the bed, they are on lunch and will help her after their lunch,” she said. She said her daughter didn’t even reach the bed. “She sat down and helped herself give birth. The newborn fell and that’s when the nurses came running.

Gauteng health spokesman Motalatale Modiba apologised to the family. He said the matter was reported to their quality assurance department for further investigation. “The department does not condone the behaviour of staff to patients as every patient has the right to good health and assistance,” he said.
