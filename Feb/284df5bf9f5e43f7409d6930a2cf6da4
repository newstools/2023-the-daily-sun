ANXIETY about school shows up in different ways, such as difficulty sleeping, stomach aches and avoiding school. Without treatment, school anxiety can lead to bad marks, loneliness and even physical illness. Here are 10 tips from Affinity Health to help children cope: 1. Talk to your child about their concerns and respect their feelings. Create an open and supportive environment where your child feels comfortable discussing their worries. Listen actively and try to understand their perspective. 2. Create a consistent daily routine. Having a regular schedule can help reduce uncertainty and provide a sense of structure and stability. Set a consistent bedtime, establish a morning routine, and have a designated time for homework and after-school activities. 3. Encourage physical activity and a healthy diet. Exercise and proper nutrition can have a positive impact on mental health and can reduce stress and anxiety. 4. Establish a calm and organised environment at home. Help your child create a calm and organised space to work and study, and try to minimise distractions in the home. 5. Encourage your child to express their feelings through art or writing. Artistic expressions like drawing, painting or writing can be a helpful outlet for children. Let your child use these creative outlets to express their feelings and thoughts about school. 6. Set small and achievable goals. Encourage your child to set small, achievable goals and celebrate their successes along the way to help your child feel a sense of progress. 7. Help your child develop relaxation techniques. Relaxation techniques can help your child manage stress and anxiety. Techniques include deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation and visualisation. 8. Motivate your child to participate in activities outside of school. Motivate them to participate in activities that they enjoy, such as sports, music or clubs. 9. Consider seeking support from a mental health professional. If your child’s anxiety persists, it may be helpful to seek the support of a mental health professional. A therapist can work with your child to identify the causes of their anxiety and develop coping strategies. 10. Work with your child’s school. Communicate with your child’s school administration to ensure they know your child’s anxiety. REGISTER TO COMMENT!
