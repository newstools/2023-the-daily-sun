THABO Ernest Nkoane has been sentenced to life imprisonment for murdering his mother and burning her remains. The 31-year-old appeared in the Phokeng Regional Court in North West on Wednesday, 1 February. He was sentenced for killing his mother, Peggy, at Buanja Lefaragatlha Village near Phokeng on 22 December 2017 by chopping her into pieces before burning her remains at home. Neighbours and Peggy’s friends were surprised by her prolonged absence from work and church. She was a primary school teacher. They were also shocked by the smoke that came from the roof of the house on the day she was murdered. Provincial National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesman Henry Mamothame said the matter was reported to the police and upon investigating Peggy’s whereabouts days later, they found burnt human remains. Nkoane was subsequently arrested and charged with pre-meditated murder. State prosecutor Obed Molope urged the court not to deviate from the minimum prescribed sentence of life imprisonment. He further indicated how Nkoane infringed on his mother’s right to life. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! Magistrate Segakweng Moeng agreed with the state and highlighted that Nkoane was not a candidate for rehabilitation as he was cold-blooded, arrogant and not remorseful. Provincial Director of Public Prosecutions Dr Rachel Makhari Sekhaolelo lauded the investigating officer, prosecutor and all role players who contributed to the conviction. “We laude community members for their role in the arrest and conviction. We need such advocacy in the fight against crime.”
