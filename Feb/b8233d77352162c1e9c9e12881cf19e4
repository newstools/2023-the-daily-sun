He said he hopes to get potential sponsors or donors who might help to contribute towards his education in America. "As someone who comes from an underprivileged background in the rural area, having experienced first-hand the negative impact of unemployment, which is a crisis in South Africa, I have always been passionate about pursuing a degree in business studies. "I strongly believe that contributing to economic development isn’t solely reliant on finding jobs in metropolitan areas, but also developing, finding or establishing business ventures in non-metropolitan areas such as in my rural area," he said.

"This is my second time being fortunate to be awarded a partial scholarship to study in America as New York Film Academy awarded me $9 000 talent-based scholarship in 2016 while completing my degree in Drama at TUT. I was offered to study acting for film in Los Angeles but unfortunately that opportunity slipped through my fingers as well due to a lack of financial assistance," he said.
