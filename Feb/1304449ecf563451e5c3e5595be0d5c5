HE’S the uncle of AmaZulu player Hendrick Ekstein. But Moses Ekstein (57) from Bekkersdal in Gauteng is not waiting for hand-outs from his nephew. He has come up with a way to make his ditlhakwana business go faster by selling them house to house. Residents call it mobile seshebo as the meat gets delivered. Moses started his business three years ago while working as a painter. He feeds his family of three with the money he makes. “We are born with talent and it is our drive to always search for what we are good at,” he said. He said the way he prepares his meat makes it irresistible for his customers. “I spice my ditlhakwana well. I work overnight preparing it for the following day,” she said. Moses said his business is growing because he treats his customers with respect. “I can’t rely on my nephew for support. He’s using his God given talent to play soccer. I watch soccer to relax and support my nephew’s soccer career.” He thanked kasi residents for their support. You must be SIGNED IN to comment!
