SEKHUKHUNE United captain Linda Mntambo is determined to use his talent to make a difference in his community. To show his determination in giving back to aspiring young sports stars and the community of Orlando West-Mzimhlophe in Soweto, the 33-year-old midfielder launched a Linda Mntambo Foundation in June 2020, his first step towards making a difference. Mntambo's foundation specialises in creating local football tournaments for young boys and girls. The foundation also takes a stand against gender based violence, donates blankets and soccer boots, Christmas gifts, and organises work-out sessions. The well-traveled midfielder believes he has so much to offer and reckons that his professional behaviour and what he shares on his social media accounts also plays a crucial part in making a difference. He believes that he's not only a captain and leader atÂ Babina Noko, but also plays a huge leadership role in his community. "I believe I'm a leader in my team, my life, and in my community. Whatever I do, I need to be selfless but also think about everyone that's watching me. And all those that look up to me and believe in me to realise that anything is possible," said Mntambo. "We are not defined by our backgrounds, and if there's a chance to change a young child's life, then it's important to do that. People always mistake the way I use social media and they think I share everything about my life. The good thing about what I do is that it can help the next person. "Whatever we do as professional players, always rubs off to the younger generation. I remember I used to buy football magazines just to read about my idols. But nowadays the younger generation get to interact and see how we work hard on social media. That plays a huge role in changing their perspectives on certain things."
