MEMBERS of the legendary gospel group, Masibuyele kuJehova, are living in poverty. It is made up of five members, Belina Nkosi, Zodwa Mashigo, Elizabeth Mahlangu, Anna Thabethe and Lizzy Khoza. Four of them depend on pension grants while Zodwa sells duvet covers. Their number one fan, Sinobomi Majangaza, reached out to Daily Sun and detailed their struggles. “I’ve been following this group for years and managed to build a close relationship with them. They are poor and their living conditions are bad,” said Sinobomi. “I also know they don’t receive royalties. This is sad because their music was on high rotation but they gained nothing from it. Seeing them suffering like this breaks my heart.” ALSO READ : Gospel star Khaya Mthethwa’s tired of being rejected! Elizabeth said they had been in the music industry for more than 35 years. “We released 13 albums but we’re still poor. People took advantage of us and exploited our talent. We realised very late that something is not right.” She said their first album, We All Know that Jesus is Coming, sold close to 500 000 copies and was on high rotation.

We paid a R50 000 deposit for a taxi and shared the balance among ourselves.” Elizabeth said their second album, Getsemane, was also a hit and sold over 400 000 copies, but they only received about R11 000, which they shared. “Then Siza Nkosi andImvuselelo Enkulu Iyeza also did well, but we received nothing. Our music was even sold abroad without our permission, but we received nothing from those sales. We also don’t get royalties from Southern African Music Rights Organisation (Samro).” Samro’s Nthabiseng Mashiyane said: “Unfortunately we cannot disclose any information to the media. We need the members to contact us directly so we can help.”
