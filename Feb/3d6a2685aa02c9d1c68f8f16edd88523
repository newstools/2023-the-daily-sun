They started an events management organisation called Bagolo Kulture. The 11-member group is made up of artists, photographers, fashion designers and singers with the aim of making an income. The organisation, which was started in 2018, has gained popularity on social media. Members are known for dressing in old-fashioned clothing and they have thousands of fans in the eastern Free State. Group leader Justice Mofokeng said Bagolo Kulture had support from a number of communities. REGISTER TO COMMENT “We are now busy with the number of events we are involved in. “Our stylish attire reminds many of their elderly family members and kwaito groups such as Alaska and Trompies,” he said. “We are now going national. Our aim is to encourage the youth to do things for themselves, and not wait for the government. That will decrease the high crime rate and gender-based violence.” The group has also started a marketing agency which assists small businesses with advertising and marketing strategies.
