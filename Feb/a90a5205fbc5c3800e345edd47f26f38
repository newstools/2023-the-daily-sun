IT'S been a week since Rebaone Majafa (20) went missing. The family of the young man from Kempton Park in Ekurhuleni needs help to find him. Rebaone was last seen by his family on Friday, 18 February when he was going to school in Braamfontein. They said the last communication they had with him was when he told them he was on his way home, but he never arrived. His aunt Gaba Majafa said Rebaone left home like he normally did, and there was nothing strange that morning. She said they started getting worried when it got late at night, and he wasn't coming back home. “His mother called him and he told her that he was in the complex where we live, saying he was coming back to the house.” ALSO READ: Desperate search to find baby Ivakele! “We became really worried when it got to midnight and he still hadn't arrived. When we called his phone again, it was on voicemail until today,” she said. Gaba said they tried to call his friends, but none of them knew where he was. “What we know is that he did go to school and come back. He was seen catching a taxi coming home and that was it. After that no one could say where he went,” she said. She said that they've been searching for him but with no luck, and they even opened a missing persons case. “We thought that by involving the police, they might help to trace his phone for his last location when we called him. “We don’t know what to do any more or where to look, and we feel like we are running out of time as the days are going by,” she said. Daily Sun contacted the Gauteng police, and they are yet to respond.
