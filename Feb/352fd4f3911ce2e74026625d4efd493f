MAMELODI Sundowns won’t give up confidence on one of their star imports, Bolivian international Erwin Saavedra despite his struggles with injuries and adaptation to the PSL since joining the club. Despite his undeniable talent, Saavedra (26) has struggled to settle in Mzansi and the PSL, and is yet to show his club what he can do on a regular basis because of injuries and adaptation issues. Saavedra joined Downs on an estimated R12,25 million in February last year from Bolivar, and a lot was expected from him when he finally touched down in Mzansi. But Saavedra has only featured nine times for Downs in all competitions, and is yet to score or provide an assist for a goal. His game time has been severely restricted due to injuries and this has also been made worse by the fact that he’s found it tough to settle in the country without his family. “It’s been difficult for him,” said Downs coach Rhulani Mokwena. “It’s not easy coming from a different country, an area where the football is different, the food is different and everything else (is different). He comes into a country where he doesn’t bring his family. He’s got a new born baby boy and it becomes very difficult to be in South Africa without knowing how the boy is doing every single day.” Nevertheless, Mokwena insists that once Saavedra overcomes his struggles with injuries, things will start looking up for him and he will show what he is capable of. “An adaptation period will always be important when going to a different club, a different league with different style of play and expectations,” added Mokwena.
