MASESI Ndlovu said she could not believe that her husband hit her over the head with an axe handle because of a cricket. The 52-year-old from Mamelodi, Tshwane, was allegedly hit on the head by her husband of 15 years on Sunday. She said they were in the house when a cricket started chirping. Earlier that day, her husband had seen it inside. “He told me to find the cricket as it was going to make noise at night. I told him I was going to look for water because we didn’t have some,” she said. She then told him she would remove it in the morning because she was tired, but he wanted her to stop its noise as it was irritating him. And that’s when he allegedly hit her over the head with an axe handle. “I was shocked and scared because he hit me hard,” she said, adding that she had an operation years ago. ALTHOUGH her ancestors gave her permission to continue with her studies, her school principal is allegedly prohibiting her from attending classes. The 15-year-old grade 10 pupil at Portia Shabangu Secondary School in Tekwane South, Mpumalanga, was allegedly told to finish her initiation process first before she can proceed with her studies.  “He knows that my head is sensitive, but he hit me where I was operated on.” Masesi said she had been trying to leave him, but he always asked her back. “He drinks and smokes dagga, hence he does these things. I wanted to go to the police station but because I’m living with him and he’s taking care of me, I don’t want him to go to jail.” She said she just wanted him to stop beating her.

He needs help because I know he’s a good person.” The husband, Mfungelwa Mahlomuza (57), said he would not beat her again. “I need respect because she talks to me like I’m a child.”
