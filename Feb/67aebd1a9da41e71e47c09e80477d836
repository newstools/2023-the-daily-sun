THE Eastern Cape is on high alert after two cases of highly infectious measles were detected. With five other provinces having already declared measles outbreaks, the Eastern Cape Department of Health is scaling up the immunisation of children aged six months to 15 years. According to Eastern Cape health spokeswoman Yonela Dekeda, the measles cases were detected in a 14-year-old girl in Nelson Mandela Bay, who just returned from Zanzibar and a four-year-old boy in the King Sabata Dalindyebo. Dekeda said: “After the two cases were recorded, children aged six months to 15 years who live within a 5km radius of the areas where the cases were recorded are immunised to prevent further spread of the highly infectious disease. “Healthcare workers have also visited schools to offer the jab. Only pupils whose parents or guardians have signed consent forms have been immunised at schools. No additional cases have been detected.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments The department will scale up measles immunisation in health facilities and in schools in an attempt to get as many children as possible protected against measles. Vitamin A supplementation on children between six months to around five years old is done to boost the immune system, organ development and growth. This forms part of the immunisation programme. Health MEC Nomakhosazana Meth said: “Four hundred and thirty-six nurses have been trained to vaccinate children and 162 vehicles have been hired to be used for measles immunisation. “Measles can be spread far easily between people, with one person infecting up to 18 people. So, it is important to protect our children by immunising them. A fully immunised child should receive two doses of the measles vaccine.” The main measles symptoms include fever and a rash, which is not itchy nor painful. Severe infection can also lead to diarrhoea, dehydration and blindness.
