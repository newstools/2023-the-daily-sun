THE City of Cape Town is clamping down on illegal dumping and littering around Cape Town. “I’m calling on our Solid Waste By-law Enforcement Unit to increase their issuing of fines to those who break our solid waste by-laws,” said MMC for Urban Waste Management Grant Twigg. “The direct impact that littering and dumping have on our residents is devastating,” said Twigg. He said littering and dumping also drive away investment in the city and lower property prices. “It gives the impression that areas are neglected by authorities and that people don’t care, which is not true,” said Twigg. He said residents reporting illegal dumping can get paid. REGISTER TO COMMENT “For every report that leads to a fine and conviction, the city is offering a reward from R1 000 up to R5 000,” he said. Residents of Gwayi Street in Crossroads said they have had enough of people and vehicles dumping rubbish at an open field near their homes. “It is disrespectful to throw rubbish in other people’s areas,” said “We wake up in the morning with rubbish piled up near our homes while we keep our rubbish in our bins,” said resident Nobesuthu Matoti. She said the area which has now turned into a dump site had a sewer spillage recently. She said they were happy when the sewer issue was fixed only to face the new problem of rubbish piling up. Twigg said the only way to deal with the problem is for the city and residents to work together. “Civic action is only one way in which residents can join the fight against littering and dumping. We continue to encourage our residents to report those responsible so that penalties can be applied,” said Twigg.
