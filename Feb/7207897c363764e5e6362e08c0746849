He explained that the scene had been going on from about 3pm and it took almost four hours of negotiations to convince the man not to kill himself. “One of the Tshwane Emergency Services firefighters managed to convince the man, who was attempting to commit suicide on top of a Virgin Active building in Tshwane, to come down,” said Mabaso. He said the man ultimately came down after 7pm and was handed over to the police.
