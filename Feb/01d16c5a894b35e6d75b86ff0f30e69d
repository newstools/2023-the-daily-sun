TWO suspects, both aged 28, are expected to appear in the Atamelang Magistrates Court on Monday, 13 February, on charges of damage to essential infrastructure as well as possession of explosives, ammunition and firearm. The police said the suspects’ court appearance comes after their apprehension on Wednesday, 8 February, in Madibogo Village outside Mahikeng. “That’s after members of Setlagole and Madibogo police stations, as well as Mahikeng Crime Intelligence, followed up on information regarding ATM bombing wanted suspects,” said North West police spokeswoman Lieutenant-Colonel Amanda Funani. The two allegedly exploded two ATMs on Tuesday, 6 February, in a complex and fled with an undisclosed amount of cash. “Subsequent to the incident, the police spotted a suspicious vehicle in Madibogo Village leading to a car chase. “The suspects’ vehicle ultimately stopped and two males were arrested.
