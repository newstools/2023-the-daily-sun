THINGS are now so bad at Mabel Zozo Creche that teachers have to bring water to school so that the 300 children can flush the toilets and the teachers can cook food for the children. They say the Ekurhuleni Municipality shut down their water supply last week, claiming the school owes about R1 million in unpaid rates. Head of department, Nomsa Mokoena, said the situation is bad. On Monday, 30 January, the teachers and kids marched to the offices of Duduza Customer Services to hand over a memorandum, which was received by the manager Ivy Nkosi. Nkosi said they would look into the matter. Pre-school governing member Khehla Chulu said they are rated as a business although they are a non-profit organisation. “It is disturbing that the kids are disadvantaged because of something that can be resolved,” said Chulu. He said that every month, they pay a R400 levy for municipal rates. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! Daily Sun was invited to view the state of the toilets at the creche and some of them could not be flushed as there was no water. Community member Norman Vilane said it was disturbing to see children exposed to such conditions. Ekurhuleni spokesman Zweli Dlamini said the creche owes the municipality R1 million. “They made an agreement with us and we will switch on the water but if they default, we are going to cut the water again,” he said.
