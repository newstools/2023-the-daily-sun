POLICE have arrested two men aged 31 and 32 in connection with dealing with illegal abalone, reckless and negligent driving, and assault of a police official on Wednesday, 15 February. Sergeant Sinah Mpakane said Bloemfontein police received information about a certain vehicle driving from Mthatha to Bloemfontein suspected to be delivering abalone. While patrolling the N6, about 10km away from Bloemfontein towards Reddersburg, the said vehicle was spotted. “Police tried to stop the driver but he refused to stop. A chase ensued and the suspects drove into the township of Phase 2 in Mangaung,” said Mpakane. During the high-speed chase with blue lights and sirens, the suspects lost control of the vehicle and crashed into the fence of one corner house. “The two suspects jumped off the vehicle and ran on foot. One of the police officers was injured with a sharp object on the stomach,” said Mpakane. The community of Phase 2 and Rocklands assisted the cops and also gave chase.

The cases of illegal possession of abalone, reckless and negligent driving and assaulting a police official are under investigation. Free State police commissioner Lieutenant-General Baile Motswenyane praised the communities of Phase 2 and Rocklands for helping the cops to arrest the suspects. This is the second incident of abalone recovery in Bloemfontein after a foreign national was bust with abalone worth millions last month.
