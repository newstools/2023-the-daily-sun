GAMBLING machines are often found at casinos, but that is not the case in Northern Cape. According to Sergeant Timothy Sam, cops on Wednesday, 8 February, acted on verified information of alleged illegal gambling activities at certain tuck shops in the Sol Plaatje Local Municipality. Sam said an intelligence-driven operation was executed, where identified shops were raided. “A total of 11 gambling machines, from different tuck shops, and coins amounting to about R19 000, were seized and confiscated. The Department of Home Affairs checked and verified the nationality status of the affected tuck shop owners,” Sam said in a statement. REGISTER TO COMMENT!
