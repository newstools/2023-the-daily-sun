RESIDENTS of Mbazwana in northern KZN have decided to take the law into their own hands as they’re tired of criminals living off their hard work. And to show that they’ve had enough, they have been blocking and burning any vehicle coming from the Mozambique border since last week. A total of six vehicles, including tourists’ vehicles and a bus, have been torched since Tuesday, 24 January. On Tuesday, 31 January, national police commissioner General Fannie Masemola, and KZN police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, visited the area. The commissioners were made aware that some residents were burning any vehicle with Mozambique number plates travelling on that route. Masemola appealed to the residents to stay calm as they have deployed more law enforcement personnel to deal with cross-border crime. “As of last Sunday, we have deployed at least 100 police officers who will take turns to guard the border. “We met the community leaders in the district about the problem of stolen cars which cross the border and are never found,” said Masemola. He said he brought SAPS delegates to listen to the residents so that they know where to improve to deal with this. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! Community Safety MEC Sipho Hlomuka appealed to the residents not to take the law into their own hands. He also appealed to the cops to work around the clock to crack down on the criminal syndicate that is terrorising residents. “The increase in the cases of hijackings is unacceptable. As a government we are on the side of the victims, we sympathise with the people who have been terrorised and traumatised by the criminals. and the pain people have been subjected to needs to stop,” he said. Hlomuka said they’ll also  busy making a number of interventions, including increasing the law deployment, beefing up the investigation teams, improving resources to fight cross border and facilitate talks with the Mozambique government.
