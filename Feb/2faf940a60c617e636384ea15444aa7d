Keabetswe's mum, Gaowetswe Molefinyana, said she was not coping. “We are saddened by what happened. My daughter was a friendly person and got along with everyone. She did not deserve all this. “I have never met the boyfriend. I just wonder how a person can be so cruel. He stabbed her several times, this shows his intentions to kill her,” she said.
