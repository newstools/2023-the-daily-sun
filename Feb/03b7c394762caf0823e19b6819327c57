DESPERATE patients in labour experienced double pain as rain water from a leaking roof poured on them at Mapulaneng Hospital in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. This resulted in several patients being evacuated from the ward. A patient said they thought the leaking water could be avoided as some nurses put buckets on the floor. “But it rained heavily, wetting all the beds and sheets. We found ourselves in a dam. “Even our food and clothes got soaked,” said the patient. A pregnant patient said they were thankful to the nurses who moved them to another ward. “I don’t know what would have happened if it weren’t for them. “We were getting cold and shivering. MEC Sasekani Manzini should address the issue of the construction of a new hospital because this one is old and now a death trap,” she said.

But all patients were moved to another ward.”
