Chelsea announced the signing of Enzo Fernandez from Benfica on Wednesday after days of complex negotiations between the clubs to secure the Argentina midfielder for a British transfer record 106.8 million pounds (R2 280 674 484,00). As the deadline day approached its end on Tuesday, it appeared a deal might not be reached but a statement from Benfica confirmed that it had been done shortly before midnight. Premier League club Chelsea announced the signing on Wednesday night via a video on Twitter, which showed a clip of a clock ticking down, making a reference to race against time to sign the World Cup winner.Benfica's statement said Chelsea would pay the contract release fee for the 22-year-old, who has signed an eight-and-a-half year deal with the London club.It takes Chelsea's transfer spending in January alone to close to 300 million pounds (R6 406 389 000,00) and to more than 500 million pounds (R10 679 300 000,00) since last May's takeover by an investment group led by American Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital. Boehly has sanctioned more spending in this transfer window than the combined total of all clubs in Europe's other big leagues -- the Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A and Ligue 1.According to media reports, Chelsea will pay the release fee in several instalments -- the number of which became a sticking point for the deal until late on Tuesday."Sport Lisboa e Benfica - Futebol, SAD informs that it has reached an agreement with Chelsea FC for the sale of all the rights of the player Enzo Fernandez, for an amount of 121,000,000 euros, (R2 284 363 191,44)" a Benfica statement read.
