SUSPECTS are feeling the heat. Since last week, the police have been swooping in on them. Three more suspects suspected to be involved in cash-in-transit robberies and the bombing of ATMs in Gauteng were bust in Tshwane on Monday. This follows the fatal shooting of three and the arrest of six suspects last Wednesday on the R21 just before the Olifantsfontein off-ramp near Tembisa. The suspects were allegedly going to rob a shop at Carnival City Mall in Brakpan, Ekurhuleni, when police pounced. The three suspects, aged between 25 and 40, were found in possession of high-calibre firearms, scores of ammunition, explosives and stained cash. According to information received, the suspects were allegedly planning to hit yet another ATM in Tshwane before they were apprehended. REGISTER TO COMMENT!
