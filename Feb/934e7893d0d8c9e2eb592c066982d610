EFF LEADER Julius Malema wants the presiding officer hearing his gun case to step down. Malema and his co-accused and bodyguard Adriaan Snyman will bring the application for the recusal of Magistrate Twanet Olivier on Thursday, 2 February. The two claim she is biased. EFF has welcomed the move alleging that Olivier has shown that she’s got a particular interest in how this matter must conclude. Spokesman Sinawo Thambo said the magistrate interferes and somehow leads witnesses into making critical observations, contrary to what they had made in the beginning. “First and foremost, the EFF supports the application filed for the magistrate to remove herself. The magistrate exhibited a palpable bias by leading a witness,” said Thambo.

Malema and Snyman are charged with the Contravention of the Firearms Control Act for firing the rifle in a public space and with the unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition.
