THE East London Regional Court has heard that Mdantsane Police Station held an inquiry as soon as it received video footage showing EFF leader Julius Malema discharging a firearm. Captain Nkosikho Mzuku told the court on Friday, 3 February, that he received the footage from a Captain Govender, based at the police provincial media centre, on 1 August 2018. He said the video was trending on social media. Mzuku said Govender wanted him to confirm if a political rally had taken place in Mdantsane. “Govender said I should bring the footage to the attention of the station commander. I also forwarded it to the investigating officer,” he said. Malema and his bodyguard, Adriaan Snyman, were charged with Contravention of the Firearms Control Act for firing the rifle in a public space as well as unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. It is alleged that Malema discharged it during the party’s fifth anniversary celebration at Sisa Dukashe Stadium.

Prosecutor Joel Cesar asked him if he would be able to state the type of firearm it was, to which he said: “It looks like a rifle.” Under cross-examination by Malema’s lawyer, Lourens Hordes, he conceded that in his statement he did not mention names as he was awaiting facial experts to conduct investigations. “I knew their names but I would be in trouble if I mentioned them before the report,” said Mzuku. The trial was postponed to 11 September.
