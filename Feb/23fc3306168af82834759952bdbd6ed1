A 38-YEAR-OLD suspect had to be rescued by the Barberton police from an angry mob after he was reportedly caught at the Barberton dumping site pushing a trolley with a 19-year-old woman’s body wrapped inside a bag. Mpumalanga police spokesman Brigadier Selvy Mohlala told Daily Sun this shocking incident happened on Sunday, 19 February, at about 2.15pm. He said the suspicious-looking man caught the attention of three ladies when they reportedly saw him pushing the trolley that seemed heavy for him. “The ladies then stopped a taxi operator driving in a kombi at the traffic lights, narrated what they observed and requested him to assist in investigating,” said Mohlala. Upon seeing them, the bag fell from the man’s trolley. “His bag was opened by one of these concerned citizens and it was a surprise when the body of a woman was found inside,” he said.
