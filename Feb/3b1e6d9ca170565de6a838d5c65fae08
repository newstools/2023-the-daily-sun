LATE gospel singer Deborah Fraser’s family is at loggerheads with her recording label, Universal Music. At the heart of their fight is Frazer's last and unreleased album which is finished, but has no title as yet. Guardian Nontando Mafisa told Daily Sun that the record label has failed to keep its promise. "We had a meeting with them after the funeral and they promised to release her last album. Unfortunately, that was the last time we heard from them. We are now wondering it they'll ever keep their promise. We've called them, emailed them asking about this album, but no one is responding," said Nontando. Daily Sun has seen some of the emails in which Nontando complained about lack of communication and slow progress.

It has been over a month now since Deborah passed on and her children have been waiting to hear from you. The idea is just for them to get clarity as to the standing of Deborah's contract, royalties and her latest work and if there are any expectations you may have from them." Deborah's older son, Nkosana Fraser, told Daily Sun that they were disappointed at Universal Music. "I've never dealt with Universal Music directly but Nontando has been communicating with them on our behalf. My mother worked very hard for that company. She loved that company but today it seems they have forgotten about her hardwork. We were hoping that by now the album would be out but this is not the case, and there's no indication when it'll be out. The main problem is lack of communication from their side," he said. Daily Sun approached Sipho Dlamini, the CEO of Universal Music. Sipho said that the album that Deborah Fraser had recorded before she died on the 15  May 2022, is scheduled for release on the 12 May 2023.
