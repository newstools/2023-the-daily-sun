VILLAGE pupils say their lives are at risk every time they go to school. This is because the Mpumalanga education department allegedly declined to get scholar transport for 54 pupils from Dixie Village, Bushbuckridge, saying they don’t meet the 5km requirement, despite the kids having to walk through an area populated by wild animals.

One worried pupil said: “We worry that lions or leopards will attack us.” A worried parent, Rex Ntimane, said animals often escaped from the reserve. School governing body (SGB) member Phillip Mgiba said the problem had been ongoing for years. “Since 2009, the school has been trying to get help from the department,” he said.
