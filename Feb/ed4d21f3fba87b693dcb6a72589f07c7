THERE is taxi chaos around Mfuleni and Khayelitsha after taxi drivers allegedly banned scholar transport vehicles in the areas. David Maynier, the Western Cape MEC of education, said when he visited Academia Primary School in Khayelitsha on Monday, 13 February, half of the pupils were absent due to the taxi blockage. He condemned the blockage and said they would not succumb to threats and violence from the taxi industry. He said yesterday the absenteeism rate was 90%. “Minibus taxi association members have been harassing our contracted drivers to prevent them from transporting pupils. “This is an attempt to muscle in on transport contracts and to get money from the Western Cape education department,” Maynier said.
