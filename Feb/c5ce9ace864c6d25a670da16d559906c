ANDISIWE Nqanqase is angry that a tavern bouncer sjamboked her in front of people for nothing. The 29-year-old was drinking with her friend at a tavern in Winnie Madikizela Mandela Road in Philippi, Cape Town on Friday, 3 February when the friend got drunk and put her head on the table. Andisiwe left the tavern for a few seconds with another friend and went home to change her clothes. When she came back, she took the sleeping friend out of the tavern. The bouncer swore at her and when she asked why he was swearing, he allegedly told her she was supposed to clean her friend’s vomit. “I had not seen that my friend had vomited. The bouncer didn’t let me know, but approached me with a bad attitude. He then chased us from the tavern and said we must go drink somewhere else,” said Andisiwe.

A group of women marched to the tavern last week demanding answers. Community leader, Ncumisa Zondani, said they will not keep quiet in the face of gender-based violence. "Cops must deal with this man because it is clear he is in the habit of abusing women," she said. Andisiwe's aunt Thantaswa (47) said she was shocked to see her niece with marks all over her body. "It looks like he wanted her dead because he moered her as if my niece was a snake. I want to see that man in jail," she said. Andidiwe opened against her attacker at the Nyanga cop shop. Sergeant Wesley Twigg confirmed that Andisiwe opened a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm case. "No arrests have been made. The investigation continues,” said Twigg.
