FIFTEEN suspects were arrested on Thursday, 9 February, in connection with the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) disability grant fraud. According to Captain Matimba Maluleke, between June and November 2020, a medical doctor and former Sassa administrator in Jane Furse, Mpumalanga, allegedly recruited members of the community to apply for a grant when they were not disabled. “It is further alleged that the doctor would certify on the application forms that they were disabled, then the former Sassa administrator would successfully process them,” Maluleke said in a statement.

The suspects, aged between 28 and 58, were arrested during a sting operation, charged, and will appear before the Polokwane Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on 1 March. Maluleke further said the remaining suspects, including a doctor who is now a ward councillor, were yet to be arrested.
