LINAH Jozina (48) wants the world, and especially Home Affairs, to know that she is not a dead woman walking. Pregnant Linah from Newington near Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, said the department killed her. She discovered the problem at Vryheid Home Affairs in KZN when she went to register her fifth child with her now-late husband, Bongumusa Mdletshe, in 2014. “According to the Home Affairs system, I was dead. I was then referred to the Mhala office in Bushbuckridge,” she said. She said an official told her to get a letter from her school, which she did. But the same official said she had to use her husband’s last name to make it easier because the system showed she was married. “But nothing happened,” she said. In 2018, an official in Mhala allegedly charged R4 850 to process her ID. “He said the money was to look after his kids if ever the department expelled him from work. He took me and others in a bakkie to his other office at Acornhoek Police Station,” she said. “After collecting the money, he said we were going to receive an SMS to collect the IDs, but it never happened.” Last year, the system showed that she was a Mozambican and sharing an ID with someone in Hluvukani. “I don’t know what is going to happen when my baby arrives. My other five kids also have no IDs,” she said. Linah said her second-born child obtained a bachelor pass in matric in 2022 but can’t go to university because she has no ID. Her youngest sibling can’t receive a Sassa grant as he doesn’t have a birth certificate. Mhala Home Affairs manager Robert Khoza said the alleged official was fired last year for corruption.
