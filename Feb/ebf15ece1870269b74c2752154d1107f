A FAMILY of 10 living in a zinc shack needs help. All of them, including mum and gogo Hlulekile Nkuna (46) who has suffered from mental illness for years, live in the shack in Madras in Marite, Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. When it rains they have to stand as rain water soaks almost everything. Cebile Nkuna (27), a mother of three, said they don’t receive Sassa grants after several attempts with officials. “Even our mother who is living with a disability doesn’t receive it. Good Samaritan Jabu Maile tries to make sure we have something to eat,” she said.
