SHE had 10 protection orders and one warrant of arrest against her husband, and was hoping that this would protect her. But on Sunday, 29 January, he apparently forced his way into Tinny Nkgudi’s house and allegedly hacked her to death with a panga. Her 25-year-old daughter, Carol Modjadji, told Daily Sun when she arrived home from work, she was horrified to find her mum’s bloody body in the bathtub. The suspect fled the scene in Tsakane extension 6, Ekurhuleni but residents found him hiding at a house on Monday and informed the police. Carol said she never thought her mum would be murdered. “He’s been abusive since we were young, and he was worse when he was drunk,” he said “My mum had been frequenting the police station and had 10 protection orders, but he would violate them.” He said at the time of the murder, there was a warrant out for his arrest and cops were looking for him. “I am very angry. He took away someone who was precious to us. All I want is justice,” she said. Carol said she was relieved her father was arrested.
