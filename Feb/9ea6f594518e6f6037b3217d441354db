THE City of Tshwane says it regrets the temporary suspension of Tshwane Bus Services yesterday, 31 January, due to fuel shortages. Municipal spokesman Lindela Mashigo said the city’s three fuel stations were empty following non-delivery by service providers. “It’s not yet clear as to when normal operations will resume, but the city is engaging with service providers with the hope of returning operations to full capacity soon,” said Mashigo. He said that commuters were advised to make alternative transport arrangements. “The city would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused by the interruptions to bus service operations,” he said. Commuters who rely on the buses regularly expressed concern over fuel shortages. Bridget Mokwena (37), who uses the bus from the Pretoria CBD to Hatfield, said it was bad news. She said she was not used to taking taxis and trains to work. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments “I hope this will be sorted soon,” she said. Bongi Ntuli (54) said: it would be a disaster if the problem was not solved soon. “We are struggling with load shedding and now there’s the added stress of buses without fuel. We can’t cope.” Jacob Mkhwanazi (23) said: “This is not good news. We hope this will not take long to be solved. This will leave us bankrupt as we would have no choice but to use other means of costly transport.”
