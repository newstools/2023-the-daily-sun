 SOUTH Africa is known globally as the capital of house music. And with an array of talent in this genre, it is no surprise that the Soweto-born Citizen Deep has been collecting lots of stamps in his passport. On this week’s episode of Famous Friday, we sat down with the Tsonga DJ and producer, who shared where his love of music comes from. “Being born in Soweto, one is exposed to different types of music, which has influenced and inspired me so much.
