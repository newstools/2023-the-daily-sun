The man accused of burning Parliament, Zandile Christmas Mafe has told the court to take him to an Eastern Cape hospital for a mental evaluation. Mafe appeared in Western Cape High Court on Friday where his pre-trail was set to begin. Mafe said he does not want to go to the Valkenberg hospital but preferred another hospital in the Eastern Cape through his attorney Luvuyo Godla.

We were advised by the state that they are going to investigate some of the allegations raised by our client. And obviously, we are mindful of the fact that government does not have unlimited resources. We should be as well reasonable but obviously, we don’t want to disregard the rights of our client,” Godla said.

After his arrest in January 2022, Mafe was taken to Valkenberg hospital where he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He was later released from Valkenberg to Pollsmoor prison after Magistrate Zimakele Mbalo ordered that his mental observation was unlawful. National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Eric Ntabazalila said they are not opposed to the facilities that the defense is suggesting. However, he emphasized that the recommended facility for Mafe is Valkenberg hospital. The state and the defense are in agreement that Mafe should have a mental evaluation but the issue remains on which facility is he supposed to be admitted at. Meanwhile, Valkenberg has a backlog of 111 people on the waiting list who want to be admitted to the facility.
