SOME of the camps and roads in the southern part of the Kruger National Park remain temporarily closed due to heavy rains. At least four camps have been badly affected by the floods. South African National Parks spokesman Isaac Phaahla said four camps – Lower Sabie, Crocodile Bridge, Biyamiti and Talamati – were currently not accessible. “Management is in constant communications with guests inside these camps. No threat or danger to lives has been experienced in the park, and we will continue to keep all our guests in the affected camps safe,” he said. REGISTER TO COMMENT! Phaahla added that technical services, with the assistance of ranger services, have been assessing access and are working to find possible solutions. “The floods remain fluid, with more heavy rains anticipated today. The teams will continue with assessments of all affected camps and roads, and updates will be communicated through social media as well as in person to the affected guests,” he said. “Guests are advised not to take chances and leave any camp without checking with camp management and reception about the status of the roads they plan to travel on. The rain forecast for today remains high, caution should be exercised at all times on the roads.” All access gates into the park are open, except Crocodile Bridge.
