RESIDENTS who live near a sewerage pump station are gatvol. They said the Ekurhuleni Municipality has been trying to fix the pump station for months but they are still living in kak. They said they either bring the wrong pump or a second-hand one. ALSO READ: Madala blames Eskom for 'divorce'! And because the pump station is not working, kak is pumped into the yards throughout the day. Simon Lekoane's yard in KwaThema extension 2 is one of the worst affected. He said he has been living in kak for eight months now. "I have reported this matter many times. I now just keep quiet and look because I don’t know who will help me anyway," he said. Another resident, Mokhine Mokhine, said the kak sometimes flows into his house. "We tried everything but sadly no one is listening to us," he said. Residents said about 40 houses on Rorwane, Chakale and Masanabo streets are affected. The storm water drains are also blocked because of the overflowing sewer.

Residents, the majority of whom are still paying for their properties and high municipal rates, said they are being taken for granted. "We pay for services, but we are getting nothing in return. The government only hears when people protest. Other than that, no one listens," said resident Bonginkosi Sithole. Ekurhuleni municipal spokesman Zweli Dlamini said he will engage with the relevant department to see how best to help the residents.
