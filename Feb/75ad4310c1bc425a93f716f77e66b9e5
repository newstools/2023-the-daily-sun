FORMER public protector Thuli Madonsela has declined to testify at Parliament’s Section 194 Committee inquiry. The inquiry is probing suspended Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s fitness to hold office. Madonsela said in her written response last week that she did not see “rational connection” of the questions sent to her and the work of the committee that is investigating Mkhwebane’s integrity and professional competence. She said the information sought from her was with the public protector’s office. “Having left the institution more than six years ago, it’s the institution that is best suited to respond to questions regarding its relationship with organs of state in line with its constitutional position as an independent constitutional institution that is set up to hold other organs of state accountable, including the State Security Agency,” said Madonsela. She said she would have been able to go to the office a week after she left, but her offer was turned down by Mkhwebane. REGISTER TO COMMENT! Madonsela said embattled Mkhwebane “flatly forbade” her any contact with the team she worked with, despite having asked for permission. “With matters still fresh in her mind, Mkhwebane would have had an opportunity to ask me institutional management questions ... had she not suddenly refused to meet me the week following my leaving office, despite having agreed during our handover meeting at my office on 14 October 2016, that we would continue our meeting and briefing the following week,” she said. She said regarding investigation information, the committee can rely on court findings. Madonsela said should she be subpoenaed, she would require legal representation to help get documents from the office. “This will require that the Public Protector pays for my transport to Pretoria and that time is allowed to find relevant records,” she said.
