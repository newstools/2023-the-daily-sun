ADVOCATE Busisiwe Mkhwebane has put her foot down! Her legal team will not continue working for mahala. The suspended Public Protector told Parliament’s Committee for Section 194 inquiry that is probing her fitness to hold office yesterday, 13 February, it was unfair to expect people to work without being paid. Mkhwebane appeared before the inquiry without her legal team because they have not been paid. The committee was scheduled to hear evidence from Public Protector South Africa investigator, Bianca Mvuyana, who had been subpoenaed to testify. “The legal team won’t consult with Bianca until their money is paid,” she said. She said it wasn’t a protest. “But they can’t work when they are not paid,” she said. Mkhwebane had written a letter to the chairman of the committee, Qubudile Dyantyi, raising issues of non-payment of her lawyers. She said her lawyers had been paid about 70% of the money owed to them by the Public Protector of South Africa. “The outstanding balance is apparently made up of the items which are the subject of baseless dispute raised by PPSA and secondly, a remainder whose non-payment has simply not been explained,” she stated in the letter. Mkhwebane, who sat alone in the defence chairs, told the inquiry that legal representation was her constitutional right. She said President Cyril Ramaphosa had promised her that she was entitled to full benefits of legal representation. She said she would not be able to guarantee the committee whether she would be able to continue on Wednesday when the inquiry resumes. “Let’s be sure that people are paid because come Wednesday I might not have a legal team,” she said.
