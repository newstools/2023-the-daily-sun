HE SOLD a small cellphone to a vegetable street vendor for R150 last year. But the street vendor was not willing to pay him. So on Tuesday, 7 February, the 28-year-old man approached the vendor in Duduza, Ekurhuleni, to ask for R2 from the money owed to him. But the vendor refused, saying he didn’t have the money. An argument then ensued between the man and vendor. The vendor allegedly took out a panga from his trolley and slashed the man’s upper left arm. “I did not see it coming and when he saw I was bleeding, he pulled away his trolley and hastened away. “I was screaming for help because I was bleeding,” said the man. An ambulance was called and the man was rushed to hospital for treatment. MADALA PHILLEMON had been dead for a year and it was time to celebrate his life with a tombstone.
