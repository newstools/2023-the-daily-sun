Dear MizzB I HAVE a daughter who is 12 years old and her mother refuses me access to see her. Dear Brothas Your baby mama has no right to keep you from having a relationship with your daughter. Unfortunately, there are parents, especially mothers who still use the kids to punish their ex-partners. The good news is that the law is aware of such behaviour and has since been amended to support and protect any parent who is being limited to access his/her kids. Please visit any social welfare department or court near you for assistance regarding getting access to your child. All the best!
