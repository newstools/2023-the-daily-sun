MORE than 150 needy pupils from Malwana and Ludlow primary schools in Hluvukani and Ludlow Villages in Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga, recently had smiles on their faces. This after they received brand new school shoes from social runner and field ranger, Lennox Mathebula. Lennox and his brother, Themba, recently finished a 450km run from Gauteng to Bushbuckridge. The aim of the run was to raise funds for sanitary towels and school uniforms for underprivileged kids around Mpumalanga. Lennox, who’s also the founder and CEO of Xidulu Foundation, said in their last run, Spar donated sanitary towels worth over R45 000 which benefited three schools in KZN and two in Mpumalanga.
