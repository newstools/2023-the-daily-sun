THE general fuel levy and road accident fund will not be increased this year. This was said by Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana when he delivered the 2023 Budget Speech to the National Assembly at the Cape Town City Hall on Wednesday, 22 February. The minister said to ease the impact of the electricity crisis on food prices, the refund on the Road Accident Fund levy for diesel used in the manufacturing process such as for generators will be extended to manufacturers of foodstuffs. He said this will take effect from 1 April 2023. Godongwana said the tax revenue collection for the 2022/23 financial year is expected to total R1,69 trillion. He said this exceeds the 2022 budget estimate by R93,7 million and the 2022 mid-term budget estimate by R10,3 billion. “Over the medium-term, revenue projection is R6 billion higher that the estimated mid-term budget of 2022. As a result, there are no major proposals in this budget,” he said. Godongwana said instead of increasing tax, the government will be providing relief of R13 billion. He said the personal income tax brackets will be fully adjusted for inflation.
