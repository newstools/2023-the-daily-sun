THE International Pentecost Holiness Church (IPHC) Jerusalem, led by Bishop Michael Sandlana, briefed the media in Tshwane on Wednesday, 1 February. This was in response to allegations that the church had collaborated with the newly formed political party, United Africans Transformation, led by Abel Tau. Church spokesman Priest Vusi Ndala said they wanted to clarify the claims after reports emerged that the church had started a party. “The church didn’t start a party. Tau did. The party works with the Tau Project, an MS foundation charity programme working closely with the church.” He said the fact that Tau had been working with the church might make people think the church had started a party. Ndala said the church had not joined the party and was not part of its formation.

Tau said he was not a member of the church. “United Africans Transformation is not an extension of the church, and I am not a member of the church,” he said. He said they were not affected as they drew members from every domination. “Members of the church are encouraged to join the party and be active members. This is a political party for everyone, and we even have members who are traditional healers,” said Tau. He added that the church continued to be a parent figure to all political parties. Meanwhile, the IPHC leadership’s succession trail will start on 13 February in the North Gauteng High Court. Ndala said they were ready for proceedings as the court had set aside three weeks for the case.
