MAYIZOLE Mpongoma returned from Cape Town to perform a traditional ceremony in Dordrecht, Eastern Cape. The ceremony was held on 28 January and was meant to continue the following day. But the community was surprised when they couldn’t find Mayizole, his brother Nkosibonile and his girlfriend, Amanda Ngubenkomo, on the last day of the ceremony. So residents, with the help of the police’s K9 unit, searched for the trio and sadly, Mayizole (27) was found buried in a shallow grave on Monday, 6 February. His neighbour, Ncediswa Malilwana, said on the day of the ceremony, they heard an altercation but did not pay attention to it.
