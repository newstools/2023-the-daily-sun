The vandalism that took place last Thursday and Friday affected the water supply in areas such as Wallacedene, Bloekombos and De Novo. Mbandezi said on Thursday vandals destroyed the power supply to the pumping station and the control mechanisms. On Friday, vandals destroyed the telemetry of the water supply network at the Bloekombos and De Novo reservoirs.
