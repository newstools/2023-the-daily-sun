CAN Orlando Pirates stop Mamelodi Sundowns? That’s the question in many football fans’ minds heading into Satiurday's juicy DStv Premiership fixture, where the two giants face off at Orlando Stadium (3.30pm). Sundowns midfielder Neo Maema said there’s no special plan for this fixture as they’re focused on their goals. “We are preparing for this like any other game. We always focus on our goals, and this one is no different from all the other games. We just have to ensure we are ready for the game on Saturday,” said Maema. Sundowns are on a record 14 consecutive winning run in the league. Rhulani Mokwena’s team are favourites to clinch a record sixth consecutive league title as they head the table 21 points ahead of second placed Richards Bay, while they lead fourth-placed Bucs by 24 points. But the Buccaneers have been enjoying a purple patch, winning their last three games on the trot. Their impressive recent run has revived Pirates’ hopes of finishing in second place and qualifying for the Caf Champions League, as winning the league is no longer within their reach. This will be the fourth time meeting between the two sides. They met twice in the MTN8 semi-final, where they drew 0-0 in the first leg and Pirates won the second leg 3-0. The third time meeting was a league game in December, and Sundowns collected maximum points with a 2-0 win. With the matches between the two sides always producing a thriller, nothing less is expected tomorrow. Nevertheless, Maema said they have an idea of how Pirates will approach them: “They are a bit different. They used to play three at the back and now they play four but their game has not changed much.”
