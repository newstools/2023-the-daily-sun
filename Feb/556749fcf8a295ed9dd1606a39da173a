36-YEAR-OLD man in India stunned everyone when he was found alive and well, eight months after being declared dead and even cremated. This began when Deepak Balakrishnan Kandi disappeared, prompting cops to file a missing person’s report. The Times of India reports that an apparent breakthrough came on 17 July, when police recovered a body from a beach in Kerala, a state in India’s tropical coast, which they identified as belonging to the missing man. His family performed a funeral ceremony and cremated the body, providing closure to the saga. It wasn’t until days later that police realised the body was not that of the missing man. Instead, it belonged to another missing person with a weird resemblance. The New York Post reports that a DNA test later confirmed their wrong person’s theory, prompting police to launch a manhunt for Kandi while a local crime branch took over the investigation. REGISTER TO COMMENT! After months of searching, Margao Town cops finally made a breakthrough on Tuesday, 31 January, while surveilling hotels. A random search of accommodations on old station road led to the discovery of Kandi, and he was arrested. Apparently he had been quite busy during his “death”. He told cops that he had travelled everywhere, and was in turn informed of “his cremation” while in custody. The man simply grinned and said he wasn’t aware of his funeral before getting whisked away by cops.
