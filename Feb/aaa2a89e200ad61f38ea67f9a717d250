ALL hell broke loose at a popular shisa nyama in Ngcobo, Eastern Cape, on Friday, 4 February. Patrons enjoying their braaied meat were treated to some free-boxing action between a woman and braai master. The trouble started when she accused him of stealing her boerewors, that appeared to have disappeared in the busy braai stands. She started hurling insults at the man, only known as Terror. “I’m going to squeeze your balls if you don’t give me back my sausage. I’m used to more brutal thugs like you in East London where I work,” she screamed. Only identifying herself as Nokuzola, the angry woman unleashed some klaps at the clearly embarrassed guy. And impressed by her fighting skills, fellow patrons started urging her on. She later told Daily Sun that the man clearly had a tendency of stealing people’s meat. REGISTER TO COMMENT! “I trusted him because he is a braai master who even charged me R15. I want my boerewors and money back,” she said. Tension only eased down after the manager offered Nokuzola complimentary boerewors. Patron Mzukhona Ndlebe said the whole scene was hilarious. “I’ve never seen a woman fight a man like that. I felt sorry for the poor guy. But she was justified at being angry because the guy gets paid to braai meat; it is his responsibility to look after it. And, to lose your meat without any explanation was unfair,” he said. Laughing heartily, another patron said he could not believe what was transpiring. “The guy nearly wet his pants. She kept threatening to crush his balls as she attacked him angrily. To make matters worse, no one came to his rescue. Instead, everyone just cheered the woman on.”
