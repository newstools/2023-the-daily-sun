He was hosting young kids from disadvantaged families at Zola 2 Community Grounds, behind Zola Senior Primary and Busisiwe Primary schools, on Friday, 10 February. Mapaputsi told Daily Sun that he wanted to celebrate with them and show them love. “This is the community I grew up in. I love it and these kids are like my own. This is something I’ve always wanted to do, and will be adding on other provinces too. I just want to see kids happy, which is my goal,” he said. ALSO READ : WATCH: Rapper AKA shot dead!

We have a few projects that are currently running such as Feed our World, a breakfast club where we provide porridge to schools so pupils can have a warm meal before they start their day,” she said. Nokulunga further said they had a back-to-school project, which had brought them to the event. “Our project provides pupils with stationery, school shoes and uniforms. We love being able to deliver projects that bring change to society and no matter how small, it makes a difference,” she added.
