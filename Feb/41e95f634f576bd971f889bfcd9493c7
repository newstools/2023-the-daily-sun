In aggravation of the sentence, state prosecutor Moses Mathebe prayed for a life sentence and argued that there were no substantial or compelling circumstances to deviate from the prescribed minimum sentence,” said National Prosecuting Authority spokeswoman Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi. She added that the court sentenced the accused to life imprisonment, declaring him unfit to possess a firearm and work with children. “The court further said the name of the accused should be recorded in the sexual offender’s book.”
