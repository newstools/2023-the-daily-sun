IT has been a great few months for Idols SA season 18 winner Thapelo Molomo. Since winning the singing competition in November, he’s been getting gigs and being celebrated in many places, including his workplace – the South African Police Service (SAPS). A big celebration was held for him on Tuesday, 14 February, at the Potchefstroom SAPS. The North West province was officially recognising and celebrating the singer for winning, and he was also handed an award and certificate by the force. Thapelo works as a counsellor for the SAPS.

These celebrations encourage me to say the level of impact within the SAPS was seen and recognised, and they appreciate it,” he said.

They didn’t want to distract me but wanted me to proceed with my plans,” he said. A post shared by Thapelo Molomo (@thapelomolomo0)
