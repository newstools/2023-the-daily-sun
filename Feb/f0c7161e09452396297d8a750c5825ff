NKULULEKO Mashinini is looking for a new acting job. The 29-year-old, who plays Sinethemba on Mzansi Magic DiepCity, has become unemployed after Black Brain Pictures announced in August last year that the show would be canned. The telenovela will end next month. At the time, show producer Mandla N said: “DiepCity fans have played a big role in the success of the show over the past two years, and we are thankful for their support.” The role was Nkululeko’s big TV break and he has built a strong fan base.
