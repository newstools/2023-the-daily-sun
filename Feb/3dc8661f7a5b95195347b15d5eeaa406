CAPE Town Constable Ngangaphila Samagaca has appeared in the Bellville Magistrates Court in connection with a kidnapping in Delft on 22 January. Two victims were allegedly taken from their home on Empress Tree Street in Thubelitsha by four men, and held hostage in a house on Crescent Road, Phillipi East. After the victims’ Ford Ranger bakkie that was stolen on the day was found dumped at Covid-19 informal settlement in Driftsands, cops acted on information and a manhunt ensued, leading them to Philippi. The suspects briefly appeared in court on Thursday, 2 February. The constable and his co-accused are facing charges of kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. “The team followed up on information on the victims’ whereabouts and made a breakthrough, resulting in the four suspects being arrested,” said Hawks spokeswoman Zinzi Hani.
