THANDAYIPHI Thabethe (39) appeared before the Itsoseng Magistrates Court on Thursday, 16 February, for possession of suspected stolen property. He was remanded in custody until his next appearance on 23 February. According to police spokeswoman Colonel Adele Myburgh, his appearance was emanating from an incident reported on Tuesday, 14 February, when traffic officers stopped a truck in Bodibe village, near Itsoseng, during routine patrol duties. “The driver was requested to present his licence, which he could not do. He was requested to open the back of the truck but became aggressive. Then two passengers fled the scene,” said Myburgh. “Police were called to the scene for assistance and they escorted the truck to Itsoseng Police Station, where they found 57 goats and 27 sheep at the back. The driver could not account for the animals or produce any permit. He was arrested while the animals and truck were impounded,” she added. REGISTER TO COMMENT!
