SOME parents are good at parenting while others don’t have a clue of how to go about being good at this. And for this reason Lindiwe Nkosi, the founder of Schechinah Foundation, saw the need for a parenting programme. Her non-profit organisation aims to nurture, teach, support and take care of the well-being of parents and children by equipping them with the relevant skills. Upon launching it, the first batch of people who took part in the programme was honoured at a graduation ceremony at Mampudi Primary School in Vosloorus, Ekurhuleni. “Our programme enables parents or caregivers to be better nurtures and community builders,” Nkosi said.

Participant Zama Hlubi said the programme changed a lot of things in her life. “I thought I knew what I was doing, only to find that I knew nothing. It has taught me a lot and not only about my children, but also about myself as a parent.” Nkosi was happy that the event was a success, with hopes to grow the organisation and gain more participant. She further sent her gratitude to everyone who formed part of the initiative and those who attended.
