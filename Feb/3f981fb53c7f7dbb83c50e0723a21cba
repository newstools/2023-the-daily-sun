ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa has suggested that they are considering declaring a national state of disaster as load shedding continues to cripple the economy. In his closing remarks at the ANC national executive council (NEC) meeting on Monday, 30 January, Ramaphosa said: “It was observed that it would be necessary to have a national state of disaster because that would enable us to fully address the challenge that our nation faces.” He said government is discussing whether the energy crisis fulfils the legal requirements for the measures previously used to manage the Covid-19 pandemic. Ramaphosa said the party NEC have backed the call for the state of disaster to speedily address the country’s power crisis sooner than the time given by the government of 18 to 24 months. He said a national state of disaster would form part of discussions during the cabinet lekgotla today, 1 February. Meanwhile, ANC secretary general Fikile Mbalula said the NEC Lekgotla has encouraged the president to declare a national state of disaster, which will also require that the ANC reconnects with their communities. The DA supported the move. Shadow minister for energy Kevin Mileham said the ANC was finally left with no choice but to agree to the DA’s long-time belief to declare Eskom an ANC-made disaster. You must be SIGNED IN to comment! “The DA re-emphasises our long-held position that any declaration of a state of disaster should be strictly ring-fenced around Eskom and the electricity sector,” he said. “But such a declaration must be subject to complete and transparent parliamentary oversight.” Civil rights organisation Solidarity expressed fierce criticism against the idea of declaring a state of disaster. According to Solidarity, it is rather the government’s inability to use their current powers that led to the crisis and a state of disaster will once again open the door to large-scale corruption and fraud. The EFF has also rejected the call for a state of disaster.
