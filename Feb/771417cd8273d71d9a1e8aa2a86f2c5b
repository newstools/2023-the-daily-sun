SHE finally gathered the strength to attend court, but the outcome felt like a slap on her face. Agnes Mtshali was in the Benoni Magistrates Court on Monday, 13 February, for her son’s matter. Her son, Sphesihle, has been missing since Christmas Eve. He was allegedly knocked down by a former Metro cop in full view of witnesses, and when he loaded Sphesihle into his car, the family thought he was taking him to hospital. But Sphesihle never made it to hospital. During Monday’s court appearance, the family, along with the SunTeam, kept getting moved from one courtroom to another. They were moved from court two to six, then to court 11 and back to court two. She told Daily Sun she was disappointed in the law and felt cops were dragging their feet in trying to find her son. She revealed that three people told them they suspect Sphesihle’s body was in a certain dam, but no one was helping them with a search party. “Not only have I been having a hard time sleeping, but I’ve been sick physically. So today was a slap on the face,” she said. Sphesihle’s girlfriend and baby mama, Busisiwe Shezi, expressed how hurt she was by how the court was treating them. “We don’t have cars. We all travel by taxi and are spending money that we don’t have,” she said. She said she felt the law would fail them either way as they were already struggling to help them find her boyfriend. “At this point, we just want to know where he hid his body. We don’t care about anything else anymore,” she said. The Metro cop will appear in court again on 23 March.
