DAYS of bickering and botched special sittings in the eThekwini Municipality have ended in victory for the ANC. The party was able to keep the mayoral chain around Mxolisi Kaunda’s neck after a motion of no confidence was tabled against him. The party was taken by surprise when the speaker, Thabani Nyawose, decided at the last minute to also include Kaunda’s motion of no confidence at a special council sitting. The meeting was aimed at electing a new deputy mayor to fill the vacancy that came after Philani Mavundla of the Abantu Batho Congress was voted out in a vote of no confidence. The EFF dumped the IFP last week after they had clashes over certain issues. The EFF and the ANC joined forces to vote for the ANC. Kaunda received 126 votes for him to stay against 81 councillors who voted against him. The vacant deputy mayor’s seat was filled by Zandile Myeni of the National Freedom Party who got 128 votes out of a total of 209 ballots with the backing of the ANC-EFF alliance. Myeni told the media that in a hung municipality you needed people who can work with others. “I am not going to be a puppet,” said Myeni.

Sishange is filling the position which was left opened by Thembo Ntuli, who will temporarily lead the city’s human settlements and infrastructure committee after Mavundla was booted out.
