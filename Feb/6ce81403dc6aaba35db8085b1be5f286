A GOOD time over drinks almost ended tragically when a friend stabbed another. And now Bongiwe Woza is nursing wounds after her friend allegedly stabbed her four times in Lethabong, Tshwane on Monday, 13 February. The 37-year-old said she has never been stabbed before and the pain she felt was terrible. She said her friend, Vuyo Tyebela (35), stabbed her with a knife, but the incident happened so fast she couldn’t run away. “My only sin was to ask her boyfriend to buy me a Black Label quart. I never thought she’d be jealous because she is my friend,” she said. Bongiwe said that her friend accused her of trying to steal her boyfriend as she looked like a yellow bone. “I will now stay far away from her because she is not comfortable when I am around her and her boyfriend,” she said. “I am feeling pain. My friend almost killed me,” she said. Bongiwe said they were drinking together and her friend normally jokes that she will beat her, but she never took it seriously. She said a man took the knife away from Vuyo during the fight, which saved her life. “I am still in pain and struggling to do anything at home,” she said. She said she’s waiting for her friend to apologise. “We drink alcohol together and spend time together,” said Bongiwe. She said she won’t open a case against her friend, but is still waiting for an apology from her. Vuyo said she stabbed her friend because she was angry. She said her friend also klapped her for no reason. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments “I haven’t apologised to her, but will visit her and see how she is doing,” she said.
