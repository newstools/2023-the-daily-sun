HOUSE duo 2point1 wants to uplift local musicians. Prince Baloyi (31) and Moeketsi Rathebe (33) told Daily Sun they had received many requests from up-and-coming artists to work and learn from them. The two musicians from Welkom, Free State, who are known for their hit Stimela, said they realised many people had talent but not connections. Prince said they decided to do studio sessions with young artists and to take them to gigs to help them get exposure. He said they featured some of them in an upcoming project.
