KWAZAKHELE residents are living in fear after another mass shooting claimed the lives of four people and injured three others. The shooting took place at a house in Nomjila Street in KwaZakhele on Sunday, 12 February. According to police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu, a patrolling police van was stopped by a woman at about 12.45am. The woman alleged that she and other people were shot at by unknown men. She said: “Eleven people were drinking and enjoying themselves at the house when three unknown men entered and started shooting. Four people were fatally injured while three people were injured and another four people escaped unhurt. The owner of the house, aged 28 years old, died in the incident.” “The Provincial Organised Crime Investigation team in Gqeberha took over the investigation into four counts of murder and seven attempted murders. The motive for the shooting and the suspects are unknown at this stage. The next of kin of the deceased are still being traced and verified. The deceased are between the ages of 20-25 years old,” said Naidu.

Our city used to be called a friendly city but now it has turned into a bloody city. We are also afraid of talking to the police because the same police are friends with these criminals. I think the police need to clean their house first in order to win this war against criminals.” This comes after 11 people became victims of a deadly shooting about two weeks ago in Maqanda Street in KwaZakhele, leaving eight people dead and three injured.
