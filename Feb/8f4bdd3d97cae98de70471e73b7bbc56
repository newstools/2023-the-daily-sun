“I HAVE been made up as a murder suspect.” These were the words of Wellington Sangweni, the man arrested alongside former Mkhondo mayor Vusi Motha. Sangweni told the Piet Retief Magistrates Court in Mpumalanga on Thursday, 2 February, that cops had made the public and citizens of Mkhondo to believe that he was linked with the murders of ANC councillor Sbonelo Ntshangase and two others. The 52-year-old told the court that he was neither charged for any murder nor was he linked to them. “Despite the fact that there’s lack of evidence in this regard, I’ve been made up as a murder suspect and have been arrested in connection with them. This information that has been fed to the public and citizens of Piet Retief is untrue, and only intended to cause outcry,” he said. Sangweni was arrested last Tuesday and charged with contravention of the control of firearm act as well as failing to keep record of the firearm, ammunition and firearm registers.

It’s alleged that three men entered the yard and fired multiple shots at the victims. The court heard how Sangweni instructed his manager to give Motha a firearm without following procedure. Colonel Albert Cornelius indicated that Sangweni, who owns a security company, was only allowed to issue firearms to his employees. The matter was postponed to Monday, 6 February for further bail hearing.
