A YOUNG boy who was allegedly stolen by his grandparents has been returned to his aunt. And it’s all thanks to Daily Sun’s intervention. The 35-year-old aunt from Meyerton, south of Joburg, approached the People’s Paper for help after her 12-year-old nephew did not return home after visiting relatives in December. She learnt that the relatives took the boy to KZN and were reluctant to return him, promising to bring him back month end. So the aunt involved the police and the boy finally returned home on Monday, 6 February. The aunt said she was very happy. “They had been promising to bring him back, but never kept their promise. I thank Daily Sun and the police for their intervention,” she said. The boy was supposed to have gone back to school last month. “He has missed classes, but we will help him catch up,” said the aunt.

He came alone in a taxi with only a note informing the taxi driver where to take him. “They didn’t even call to check on him,” she said. The aunt said she asked the boy to choose where he wanted to live, and he refused to go back to his grandparents. She said she thought she was doing the right thing when she took him to visit his late father’s relatives. In the past, he had visited them several times and would return, but this was not the case in December. “I raised the boy from when he was still a baby after his mum died a few months after giving birth to him. The boy knows me as his mother and I’m protective of him. I regret opening up to them. I thought I was doing the right thing,” she said. She said she reported the matter to the social workers in Vereeniging, who are handling the case.
