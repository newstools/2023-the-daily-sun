THE taxi industry in Cape Town is set to park all their vehicles in a stayaway set for Wednesday, 22 February. Santaco spokesman Nceba Enge said they have been speaking to the City of Cape Town and the Department of Mobility about their grievances, but none has been addressed. Among many other grievances, Enge said that their taxis are being impounded for not having operating licences, yet the relevant authorities are failing to issue such licences. He said when the Paarl to Bellville (B97) route was closed for taxis in July 2021, Golden Arrow buses were introduced and were supposed to stop operating after it was reopened to taxi associations in December last year. Enge also said they have a problem with the government issuing licences to ehailing taxis.

We do not want this stayaway, but we are left with no option because the government is not listening to our concerns,” said Enge. When Enge spoke to the SunTeam on Tuesday morning, he said he was going to a meeting with the City of Cape Town and the newly appointed MEC of Mobility Ricardo Mckenzie on the matter. He said if they agree during the meeting, they may consider suspending the stayaway.
