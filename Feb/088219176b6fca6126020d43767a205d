 ALMOST every week a person is killed in cold blood in Tshwane. Last month Bacardi music star Vusi Ma R5 was shot and killed near a tavern in Soshanguve and then last week, Tshwane’s socialite Jerry was also brutally killed near a tavern in Mabopane, Tshwane. Last year November, Tshwane DJ and producer DJ Sumbody was killed in a hail of bullets in Woodmead, Joburg. Speaking to Daily Sun, Archbishop Itumeleng Makgato (42) from The General United Apostles Church of Christ in South Africa said it is time people of Tshwane went back to God. He said he believed the world was in God’s hands and that people must respect it.

He said people have forgotten God. “We are just living lawlessly, and we don’t care about God anymore, for example we can’t demand the things that belong to God when we don’t follow him,” he said. He said if the people of Tshwane started praying and obeying God, there would be peace. “Matthew 6:33 says that if you seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness all the things that you are worried about shall be added unto you. We now want to do easy things and take God’s things, but we are not God’s people,” said Makgato. Bishop said he had been burying too many people in his area. “It is so sad and heart breaking how people die. They get brutally killed,” he said. He said that it was time people of Tshwane stood up and be united. “If we all become one and pray for this place, God will listen,” he said. He said he had been a bishop for seven years and he never thought he would be sharing the word of God like he was now.
