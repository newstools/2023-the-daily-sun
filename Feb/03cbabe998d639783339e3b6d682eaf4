KANANA residents need help to rebuild their shacks. Eight shacks in the area of Tembisa, Ekurhuleni, were destroyed in a fire on Wednesday, 25 January. A resident told Daily Sun the fire started in her shack but she had no idea what caused it. “It just started out of nowhere but people think I was doing something reckless,” she said. Although a number of families lost all their belongings, no deaths or injuries were reported.  Resident Bafana Masuku (41), whose house burnt down, said: “It’s not even winter yet but we’re already experiencing shack fires. “This is sad because we were educated on fire precautions but people clearly don’t listen.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments Sinenhlanhla Mavimbela (33) said she would stay with her mamfundisi until she could rebuild.
