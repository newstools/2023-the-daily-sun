FOR the past 10 years, cars have crashed into gogo Nozukile Menziwa’s wall at least six times. And the 71-year-old gogo from Crossroads, Cape Town, has had enough of it. The latest incident was on Tuesday, 31 January, when gogo was woken up by a huge bang at about 4am. When she checked, there were two taxis in her yard. “When I heard the bang I knew it could be a crash because this has been going on for years. The problem is that these drivers do not stop at the three-way stop next to my yard, leading to accidents. All of them say they don’t see the stop sign because it has faded,” said gogo Nozukile. She said this excuse is lame as there are metal stop signs and drivers must read them. However, gogo is grateful that all the accidents have not resulted in deaths.

Vehicles even crash into the fence at Imbasa Primary School, which is opposite gogo’s home,” she said.
