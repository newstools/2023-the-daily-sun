TLOF TLOF in the toilet at a funeral is never a good idea – but for a 37-year-old man from Kwaggafontein, Mpumalanga, it almost turned into a disaster when his 4-5 gave up. But that was in December and he is happy to report that he and his 4-5 are good friends again. He said after the article was published in Daily Sun on 19 December, he received calls from some chancers who wanted advance payment but also from a prophet who offered to help him for free. He told him he lives in Tweefontein, which made things easier for him as it isn’t far from his home. “I went to his home in Tweefontein and he helped me cleanse and gave me holy water to drink every day for seven days,” he said. Then the prophet sent him to the cemetery where the deed had been done and pray hard for three days. He was told to stay away from women for this period. “I prayed and sprinkled the holy water around my mum’s grave,” he said. On Saturday, 11 February, he called an ex to come over for drinks and movies. “Yes I had intensions when I called her, don’t judge me,” he said. One thing lead to another and the tlof tlof was perfect. He said when he realised his 4-5 was working, he was happy and said a silent prayer. “From now on, I’ll just stick to what I know. I’m ready to settle down with a wife and have more kids.” His brother (41) said he wanted his little brother to stay with a disfunctional 4-5 for a few more months so he can learn his lesson. “I hope he never does such a stupid thing again. He’s too old to be having sex everywhere,” he said.

I did it because we have all made mistakes. He shouldn’t suffer from this for the rest of his life,” he said.
