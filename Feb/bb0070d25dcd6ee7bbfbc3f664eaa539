THE Democratic Alliance has lost yet another big metro in Gauteng. This after some unexpected turn of events during the secret ballot vote for the City of Tshwane mayor on Tuesday, 28 February. The City of Tshwane Council voted for Tshwane council speaker and member of Cope Dr Murunwa Makwarela as the capital city's new mayor. He had gone head-to-head with DA member Cilliers Brink, who was selected by the Tshwane multi-party coalition to stand in for the post.

Makwarela received 112 votes against Brink who secured 101 votes. The election of the new mayor came after the resignation of Randal William earlier this month. The South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) in Tshwane welcomed Makwerela's election. It's spokesman, Nkhetheni Muthavhi, said it was unfortunate that the city has had five executive mayors since 2016 and this has created a lot of instability in the municipality. He said there was a need to reverse that unfortunate situation. “It is our belief that the newly elected executive mayor of the City of Tshwane will deliver a people-centered government which will be in the best interest of Tshwane residents,” said Muthavhi.
