TWO women and a man have been arrested for kidnapping a lawyer from Bellville in Cape Town on Friday, 17 February. This after the lawyer did not return home from work that evening. His wife reported him missing to the police. The police, with the help of the lawyer’s business partner and secretary, went to his office where they found some files on the table, which helped them with the investigation. Cops first visited the place of a woman from Belhar, who had visited the law firm the previous day. When they arrived at the place, they questioned the husband who didn’t know the whereabouts of his wife. ALSO READ | Shock as woman’s body found in man’s room!
