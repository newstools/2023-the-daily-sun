THE late actor, Menzi Ngubane’s life has been turned into a film. His friend and producer Siyabonga Zungu told Daily Sun that the research and development stages has already been done. "It will be a 13-part series that will air this year or next. In our minds we already have characters, now we have to start the actual casting and headhunting for those roles. At this point, we have not given the series a title, but as soon as we get everything sorted out with the broadcasters, we will introduce the series to the public," Siyabonga explained. Siyabonga said: "In this film, people will see who Menzi was in front of and behind the camera. The film will also show that he was actually born and raised in Johannesburg and not in KZN as most people believe. He did not discover his home of KZN until later in his life." This film will be followed by a book telling Menzi's life. "Fortunately, we already have the content which makes it easier to write this book. We have already started the process and are now talking to publishers. We decided to write his book to keep his legacy alive. The book will be published between 2024 and 2025. In 2026, we will hold a one-time award ceremony in honor of his life," said Siyabonga. Sikelelwa Ngbane, Menzi's wife, told Daily Sun that all these three projects will keep her husband's legacy alive. "I am so excited about these projects because they will ensure his legacy stays alive, and I wish he was here to witness it all. My husband loved his craft and wanted to take the industry to a new level. He had big plans for the South African film and television industry. The documentary, which is already in theatres, was his idea and that of his friend Siyabonga. Unfortunately, time was not on his side, so Siyabonga had to go ahead and fulfil his dream," said Sikelelwa.
