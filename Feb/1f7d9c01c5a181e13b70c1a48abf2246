FRIENDS of Cleo Diko, whose body was found under a bed in a house in Mandalay, Western Cape, marched and gathered outside the suspect’s house. Cleo went missing on 14 October last year and her body was only found on 27 January this year under the bed of the already arrested suspect, Sandile Jekwa. He has appeared in court. Dressed in black outfits, the group of more than 50 people sang and danced, remembering Cleo’s life on Saturday, 11 February. Western Cape Health and Wellness MEC Nomafrench Mbombo was there, and she said Cleo didn’t deserve to die.

No parent deserves to give birth, only for the child to be killed. Another speaker, Bontle Hans, said men must have an honest conversation among themselves on how they treat women. “We are being killed as women, whether we talk or we don’t, we are still being killed. “We are killed by people who we trust, people we live with. These are the people who are supposed to protect us. “Men must sit down and reflect wherever they are and speak to each other about these things,” said Bontle. Nonzame Sili from the Baphi Abafazi, a group that fights against gender-based violence, said some of the killings and the raping of women are driven by drugs and alcohol. “Our children consume and smoke everything they find on the streets. As parents, do we have time to look inside the bags of our kids when they go to school?” she said. Nonzame said parents must be active in moulding the lives of their children. Sector Community Policing Forum chairperson Juwa Dimande said Cleo’s murder left the community heartbroken. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments
