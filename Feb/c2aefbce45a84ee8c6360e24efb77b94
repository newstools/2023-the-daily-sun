FORMER soccer star Bennett Chenene’s younger sister disappeared without a trace near her home on 10 December. He is now offering a R10 000 reward for her safe return. He said he has been searching for Nomvula (28) since 11 December. “My mother told me that my sister went out with her friends to a nearby tavern, but she never came back. Many people have come to my home since and some called to tell us they have seen my sister at shopping complexes and at an open field. We went to various prophets who told us my sister is still alive,” he said. Bennett believes his sister is still alive, but is scared something might happen to her as she is lesbian. “She is not someone who goes days without coming back home. I go out to search for her every day,” he said. REGISTER TO COMMENT! He said he is offering a reward to anyone who knows his sister’s whereabouts or has any information about her. “We get calls every week that she was seen in areas such as Orange Farm, Sebokeng and Palm Springs, and our efforts in finding her have never materialised anything.” Police spokesman Captain Teboho Lephoto said a missing person’s case was opened and appealed to anyone who might have information to report it to the nearest cop shop.
