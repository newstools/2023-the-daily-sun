THE ANC’s Paul Mashatile was sworn in as a National Assembly member on Monday, 6 February. This gets him one step closer to being Mzansi’s deputy president or an official cabinet member. He was sworn in alongside Maropene Ramokgopa, Sihle Zikalala and Parks Tau. REGISTER TO COMMENT! The swearing-in was facilitated by Parliament Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, in which they all swore to be faithful to the Republic of South Africa and obey, respect and uphold the Constitution and all other laws of the Republic. Four Members of Parliament, Maseko Dikgale, Tshilidzi Munyai, Matshidiso Mfikoe and Mervyn Dirks, had to resign last week, to make room for the new members who may also be chosen to be part of the cabinet, when President Cyril Ramaphosa announces the reconfiguration of his cabinet. Ramaphosa is expected to reshuffle the cabinet before his State of the Nation Address on Thursday, 9 February.
