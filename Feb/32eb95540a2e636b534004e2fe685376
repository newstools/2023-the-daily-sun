A GROUP of activists gathered outside the Cape Town International Convention Centre, where the African Mining Indaba 2023 was taking place. They said mining companies were exploiting resources, especially in poor areas but left them without uplifting the lives of residents. Secretary of the Council of Swaziland Churches Reverend Zwanini Shabalala, who was part of the group, said they were gathering to send a message to big companies. “We want to highlight the challenges of poor people who are suffering in the hands of mining corporates. They make profits out of the land of poor people by extracting minerals, and leave the same people in poverty,” he said. Another activist, Marvin Mike Banda from Malawi, said mining was leaving distraction on both livelihoods and the environment. You must be

In many instances, they just come and mining from our areas and take the profits and leave. People are left with open land that is dug up – nothing else. People who are affected by mining activities must also be heard. They must have a say because the effects of the mines affect them,” said Banda. Another activist Mandla Hadebe said they had, for the past 14 years, held their alternative mining indaba alongside the official one. “We have been consistent in asking these companies to be responsible and consider people who are affected. This year, again, we have engaged and gave them our memorandum of demands and changes we except to see on how they operate,” said Hadebe.
