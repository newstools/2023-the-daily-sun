THE Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation’s assets forfeiture unit has secured a R547 300 final order against an alleged illegal cigarettes smuggler. On 12 November 2019, at the Beitbridge Port of Entry, cops spotted a suspicious truck with two trailers in the vicinity of the border. Upon being searched, they discovered false compartments loaded with boxes containing illicit cigarettes. The driver was arrested and the illicit cigarettes, together with the truck and two trailers, seized.
