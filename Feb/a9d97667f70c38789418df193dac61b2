UP-AND-COMING maskandi singer, Nhlaka Miya, wants to motivate men to fix their sleeping 4-5s and stop apologising to their partners when they cannot perform in bed. And he is doing this through his 10-track album, I'm Sorry, which is dedicated to men with sleeping 4-5s and bedroom problems. The 30-year-old from Ixopo, KZN told SunBuzz he once had a problem with a sleeping 4-5 and heard many people whisper in corners. But he was afraid to talk about it.

I noticed it was bad to say sorry and I realised it is time for men to talk about this and get help. “Many men in Mzansi are facing this situation and they are shy to speak about it and get help. They keep saying they are sorry when they mess up,” said Nhlaka. He said that he is using his music to tackle a topic that is affecting residents but are shy to talk about. “As a musician, I have the power to convey a message to people and talk straight about what is affecting them. In the past, maskandi was known as a genre with a message and one that was not shy to speak about what is happening to residents. I’m bringing it back to that,” he said. He said he grew up listening to and loving the music of Phuzekhemisi, Inyonemhlophe, Ichwane Lebhaca, and many more.

He said that he is preparing to release his next album in October. “I want to make my mark.
