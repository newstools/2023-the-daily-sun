KAK symbolises isichitho in a dream. This is according to Digital Bones sangoma Nzama Maluleke. He was interpreting the dream of a SunReader who said he was walking on kak. He wrote: “I dreamt I was walking and when I looked around me there was poop everywhere. The more I tried to walk away from the poop, the more I was stepping on it. I was covered with poop up to my knees.” Nzama said this was not a good sign. He said: “The man has been cursed with isichitho.” Isichitho has been described as a spell put on someone to make the person less attractive to others and wherever the person goes, nobody wants to associate with them. Nzama said: “He has been living with isichitho for far too long. If he looks back on his life, he will realise that nothing has been working out for him. Whatever he tried to hold on to suddenly disappeared.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments  He said: “This will continue until he gets rid of isichitho.” Nzama recommended a gifted sangoma. “Not every sangoma has the spiritual gift to remove isichitho. But it is possible for it to be removed. He shouldn’t delay any further because he is not getting anywhere in life,” said Nzama. You can contact Digital Bones on bones@dailysun.co.za
