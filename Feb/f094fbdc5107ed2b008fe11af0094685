SEKHUKHUNE United progressed to the last-16 of the Nedbank Cup for the first time in the club’s history when they brushed aside minnows Liver Brothers 6-0 at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on Wednesday night. Babina Noko didn’t need to engage the higher gears as they easily strolled past the Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga-based outfit who are playing in the Men’s Regional League Safa Ehlanzeni Kruger 1 zone. Sekhukhune went to the break with a solid 2-0 lead, with goals coming from Rodrick Kabwe and captain Daniel Cardoso. In the second half, Ohizu Chibuike, Given Mashikinya, Vusi Mncube and Tashreeq Morris also added their names to the scoresheet to lead Sekhukhune to a comfortable victory. This was Sekhukhune’s third appearance in the Nedbank Cup, and the third time lucky charm was with them as they qualified for the last-16 for the first time. Babina Noko first took part in this tournament in 2021 and were eliminated in the last-32 after losing 2-1 to Maritzburg United. Last season they were eliminated at the same stage of the tournament as they lost 3-2 on penalties to Platinum City Rovers after playing to a 1-1 draw on regular time. Midfield maestro Kamohelo Mokotjo made his Sekhukhune debut as he came on in the second half, replacing Sammy Seabi. It could have been more goals for the dominant Sekhukhune but they fluffed good chances. On the flip side, Liver Brothers were making their debut in the tournament. However, their journey ends in the first round, and the players will return home and continue chasing their dreams in the dusty streets of Kildare.
