THAMI Ntuli is calling for the current model used to fund municipalities to be scrapped. The KZN South African Local Government Association chairman said the model was holding back many municipalities, especially those in rural areas where they didn’t collect revenues. The model currently being used was developed by the apartheid government and favours areas with large populations. Ntuli said this caused problems as areas with small populations also needed to fund big projects such as electrifying households. He said they ended up having to do just one project per financial year. Ntuli said the organisation did not believe it was possible to provide services in municipalities that only got R200 million for the entire financial year. “From that amount they have to pay employees and carry out big projects such as electrifying homes. “This system needs to be reviewed and changed in order for service delivery to be fast-tracked,” he said. Ntuli said the association was in talks with the minister of finance and the president to review the model because it was hindering service delivery, especially in rural areas.

Ntuli said municipalities needed to be funded according to the work they carried out.
