NEWLY appointed Black Leopards coach, Owen Da Gama, is optimistic that Lidoda Duvha will survive the relegation axe hovering over them in the Motsepe Foundation Championship. Leopards are languishing at the bottom of Championship table on 13 points from 17 matches – three points behind fellow Venda rivals Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila, who are tied with Pretoria Callies on the same number of points. The former Bafana Bafana mentor told SunSport that he’ll meet Leopards players, management and technical staff today to present his detailed plan of survival. Said Da Gama: “This is a tough job. I am starting tomorrow. I will meet Chief (Tshifhiwa Thidiela) and the technical staff who will introduce me to the team. Then I will start assessing players.” Da Gama revealed that he won’t be able to turn the club’s fortunes around without the commitment of players and the support of fans. He will decide after he assessed his squad whether there’s a need to strengthen the squad or not. “This is a big ambitious team in Limpopo province and had a longest stay in the PSL.” Da Gama says he knows the size of task that lies ahead, considering that he also helped Highlands Park gain promotion to the top flight. “We’ve got to be creative and understand much about our opposition,” he added.
