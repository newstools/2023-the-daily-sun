NO CAR could get in or out of KwaThema on Monday, 13 February. Residents of the Ekurhuleni kasi closed all exits and entrances to the area in protest against the municipality disconnecting electricity non-payers, including small businesses and households, on Friday, 10 February. Some residents said small businesses were their only means of survival while homeowners said they were unemployed. However, the municipality said business brought in money and those who used electricity needed to pay. Municipal spokesman Zweli Dlamini said there was a drive to collect revenue from all businesses and households that were not paying.
