THABO Maputla, a former cop, was found guilty of corruption on Wednesday, 1 February by the Polokwane Specialised Commercial Crimes Court. According to Captain Matimba Maluleke on 25 August 2014, Maputla, who was a detective warrant officer at Westerburg Police Station, contacted four suspects in a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm that he was investigating. Maluleke said the 53-year-old told the suspects that they were arrested, but they could R500 each for bail. “The suspects paid a total of R2 000 to Maputla while they were still kept in the police holding cells. On the very same day, Maputla booked out one of the suspects for ‘investigation’ and they went to his house where he demanded a further R2 500 for bail from his wife,” Maluleke said in a statement.
