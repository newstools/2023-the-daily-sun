AS A way to fight the crippling load shedding that is affecting Mzansi, the City of Cape Town will now buy electricity from residents who produce their own solar energy. Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis said the developments came after National Treasury gave the municipality the green light to buy electricity from residents into their own grid. “We have received the exemption from the National Treasury that we asked for many months ago. We finally received feedback on that and the news is positive. “We have an exemption and that means we can start to put in place a system in which people with solar panels on their roofs can feed power back to the city and be paid in cash for that power,” said Hill-Lewis. REGISTER TO COMMENT! The city said the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) has approved a rate of 78,98c/kWh for this financial year for the city to pay power sellers. The city also adds a 25c/kWh incentive tariff on top of this. The city expects to start buying from residents in the coming few months. “The future is now as we aim to immediately roll out the paying of cash for power. Payments to commercial customers will be possible before June and within the year for any Capetonian with the necessary city-approved generation capacity. “If you’re thinking of investing in a solar system, it just got more attractive. We aim to buy electricity from as many city-supplied customers as are willing to sell to us. These customers may now produce as much power as they can from their approved systems and feed it into Cape Town’s grid,” he said.
