MITCHELLS Plain is known as a hot spot for gangsterism and drugs. However, community member Lucy Lynn Fondling is determined to transform the Cape Town kasi into a prosperous community. She’s now educating residents using the Tools for Life programme, written by Ron Hubbard. Lucy said she was also affected by problems in the area and after deciding to act, she was introduced to Scientology Volunteer Ministers – a non-governmental organisation that provides free community intervention programmes to combat substance abuse and develop skills.

I then had the privilege of attending a life skills programme called Tools for Life,” she said. “It changed my life and I knew I had found solutions to bring relief to the pain and trauma caused by the deadly streets of my community,” she said. “The programme taught me to be calm and solution-orientated when tackling life issues. It equipped me with the skills to handle study difficulties, communication and conflict resolution.” Lucy said her passion for changing her community and support she received from others were critical in implementing the qualification programme.
