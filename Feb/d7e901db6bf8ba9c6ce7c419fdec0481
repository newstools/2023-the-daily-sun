"I'm speaking from my own experience how nyaope nearly destroyed me. So after winning the battle, I told myself that I am going to fight tooth and nail to end the scourge. Today we are at this school to warn kids against substance abuse. "I am working with my partners Sizwe Nyembe and Johannes Mtsweni. They are also former drug addicts. When they tell the kids about drugs, they know what they are talking about. We are going to visit more schools," he said.

"I don't want to smoke drugs or cigarettes because I want to live a healthy lifestyle. I want to fulfil my dreams and education is key," he said. Another grade 11 pupil, Ayanda Manyepao (22), said drugs have ruined many young lives. "I want to complete my matric so that I can have a better future. Drugs are not worth my life," she said. Teacher Schultz Malaza, who is in charge of safety and security at the school, said the school has a drug problem. "The area itself is full of drugs, especially nyaope. So, we have kids who lack father figures and as a result, drugs are rife. We thank the Ikakarambha Foundation for the good work they are doing," he said.
