THE slush fund corruption case involving former South African Police Service (SAPS) crime intelligence head Richard Mdluli, and his co-accused Solomon Lazarus and Barnard Hein, continues to suffer more delays. The three accused made an appearance in the North Gauteng High Court on Monday, 6 February before it was postponed to 4 July. This after the defence team requested further particulars in the last minutes and also to get feedback for Mdluliâ€™s legal funding review application from the SAPS. REGISTER TO COMMENT! This comes after they denied funding his legal battles. The three face charges of corruption, fraud and theft allegedly committed between 2008 and 2012 when they were at the helm of the police crime intelligence services. The matter has faced continuous delays by Mdluli requesting time to apply for legal funding from his former employer, the SAPS.
