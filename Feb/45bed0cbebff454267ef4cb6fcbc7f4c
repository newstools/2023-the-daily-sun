PASSION and dedication keep teachers at Konfoor Combined School in Ulundi, northern KZN, going even though their school is on the verge of collapse. Their love for pupils and producing the best has not died, even though they have to stand in shaky classrooms on windy days. And, the school achieved a 100% matric pass rate despite the challenges it is facing. Teachers risk their lives and those of pupils by working in classrooms with cracks in the walls, which could lead to collapse. And though it asked for help from the Department of Education, it is still waiting. Daily Sun reported on the state of the school in February 2022. And when Ulundi Mayor Wilson Ntshangase visited last year, he wasn’t happy about the state. He donated R10 000 to buy what was needed while waiting on the department for rescue. Ntshangase also donated shoes and sanitary towels to 194 girls. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments “Every year, we visit schools that perform well. It is worrying that the conditions in this one are still the same. We had hoped that it would have been assisted by relevant departments by now,” he said. He said that its state was calling for urgent help, but it seemed the department was dragging its feet. “But we are encouraged by the fact that despite the challenges, teachers are able to produce top achievers.” Principal Lungisani Shabalala thanked the municipality for the donation. “We thank the municipality for giving us words of encouragement.” KZN Education spokesman Muzi Mahlambi said the school will be awarded today to do minor renovation while they look into a long-term solution.
