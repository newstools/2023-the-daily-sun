THE ANC provincial executive committee (PEC) has resolved to recall Free state Premier Sisi Ntombela and Mangaung Metro Municipality Mayor Mxolisi Siyonzana. Ntombela’s future has been hanging after she failed to receive enough votes during the provincial elective conference last month, where she was contesting against new chairman Mxolisi Dukwana. ANC provincial spokesman Jabu Mbalula denied that Dukwana would automatically replace Ntombela and be the premier. Instead, he said, three names would be sent to the national executive committee to determine the suitable candidate. Mbalula said the PEC had resolved to redeploy both Ntombela and Siyonzana.

The ANC in the province wishes to thank these comrades for their contribution in the portfolios in which they were deployed. Furthermore, the PEC appreciates the comradely spirit with which they received the decision,” he said. He added that the PEC further resolved for the government to facilitate not less than 50 000 employment opportunities for young people in the next financial year, and grow it exponentially in subsequent years. According to Mbalula, the ANC noted what it called the proliferation of “unANC” behaviour, that saw meetings being violently disrupted, leaders attacked by rented mobs, the use of money to create social distance among members, parallel structures being established and violation of the social media policy. “The PEC resolved that all these matters need urgent attention. It agreed that the unity of the party must work for it, not against it,” he added.
