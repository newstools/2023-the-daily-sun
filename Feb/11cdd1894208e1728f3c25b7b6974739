CONTROVERSIAL rapper Emtee has been trying to clear his name for years. The 30-year-old rapper Mthembeni 'Emtee' Ndevu has been repeatedly accused by people of taking drugs. The conversation has started again, and he still claims that he has never taken drugs. On Tuesday, 28 February, he wrote on Twitter that it made him angry that he was accused of being a drug addict. This was triggered by a tweet that said: "I wish you'd quit drugs and be clean. It's possible." Emtee responded and said that he had been sober for some time and had finished with this life. "All this talk about drugs makes me angry. I've even quit lean. I've been sober for a minute, so don't give me this drug talk. I'm done with this life! Stop pushing agendas here," he tweeted.

Later, he said that people claim that they wanted to make him look careless and clumsy.
