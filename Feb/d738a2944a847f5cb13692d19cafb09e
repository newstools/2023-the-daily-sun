Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba could make his long awaited return to the pitch in the Serie A clash against Torino on Tuesday after recovering from a number of injuries, manager Massimiliano Allegri said on Monday. The France international had an operation on a damaged meniscus in September and also missed the World Cup in Qatar with the national team. The only time Pogba has been part of the squad this season was as an unused substitute in the 2-0 loss against Monza on 29 January. "Pogba will be called up for the derby and will play if necessary. He doesn't have much playing time in his legs, but more than enough," Allegri told reporters."I have spoken to him as I have done with the other players. He must understand that we're at an important stage of the season. He must have the drive to have given his contribution at the end of the season."Allegri added that forward Federico Chiesa, who has been on and off with injuries this season, is also back in regular training after missing recent games.
