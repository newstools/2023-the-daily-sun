“OUR ancestors are angry. They want the shacks erected on their graves demolished immediately!” These were the words of Emily Makhubela (31) from Mabopane, Tshwane, who told Daily Sun she and her family were shocked when they arrived at family graves to perform rituals last month and found buildings on top of them. Emily said they were left struggling to find graves belonging to three family members, including her great-grandmother, Caroline Molete, who was buried in 1983. She said residents of Skirilek in Atteridgeville had built on the graves, which were dug when the area was still made up of plots. Emily, a traditional healer, said her great-grandmother visited her in a dream complaining that she was neglected and surrounded by strangers. “Our lives will be a mess until we listen to her by finding the graves andfix this problem,” she said.

Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development Department spokesman Reggie Ngcobo said the family could report the matter to the municipality, open a case of violation of graves or apply for eviction order. “They should also approach a local councillor,” he said
