THE IFP has launched an online petition to protest against Eskom’s tariff hike. The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) announced a massive 18,65% increase in the price of electricity last month. It was met with resistance from the public, civil rights organisations and political parties. While some resorted to take the matter to court, the IFP is calling for people to sign the petition so they can have the hike reversed by April. The petition can be accessed at actnow.ifp.org.za, and will run until mid next month. IFP national spokesman Mkhuleko Hlengwa said they’ll then present the petition on behalf of all signatories to the Speaker of Parliament, President Cyril Ramaphosa, as well as Nersa. “We will request that in addition to reversing the proposed April 2023 price hike, no further increases will be granted to Eskom until load shedding is permanently suspended,” he said. Hlengwa said the IFP maintains that this tariff hike is both irrational and unreasonable. He said South Africans simply can’t afford to pay more for power, especially as the current supply provided by Eskom is so unreliable. “The plans proposed by Ramaphosa to solve the energy crisis during the recent Sona did not inspire confidence, particularly considering the timeline offered was 12 to 18 months. South Africans should not be strong-armed into paying more for a service that is not available for hours each day,” said Hlengwa.
