MEN disappeared for a moment on Valentine’s Day but this time, not to talk about how to give gifts and money to their partners. This was to discuss how they can become better versions of themselves. These men gathered in Mofolo Park, Soweto on Tuesday and spoke about how to be better men, and released 500 balloons to mark and celebrate efforts they’re putting in to becoming better versions of themselves. Most importantly, this symbolic gesture encourages other men to look in the mirror and ask themselves if they are men to be looked up to. Television crews and actors supported the men and released a further 1 000 balloons in Devland and Highlands North in Joburg. Following the release of the balloons, the first real men’s virtual conference – The Good Men Conference – is scheduled to take place on 28 February. Invitations for interested individuals can be found on Trust Condoms’ social media pages. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments The Good Men initiative, championed by Trust Condoms, is flipping the script on the vile labelling such as “trash”, “dogs”, “deadbeat” that has dogged men in recent times, which has put a spotlight on the question of whether men can be trusted. “We really believe there are men who are doing their best,” said Ndinatsei Mumbengegwi, global brands product manager at Population Services International. Justice Mukheli of The Holding Space said they’re working hard to try and get men to heal because many social ills start from their inability to heal. “We must be exemplary and encourage each other to leave the superficial and be real.”
