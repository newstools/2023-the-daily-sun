AFTER she was last seen at a pub on 14 October last year in Mandalay, Cape Town, nobody ever heard from Cleo Diko (34) again. Although everyone thought Cleo would come back, her friend, Siphelele Kwinana (29), knew something was wrong. Siphelele told Daily Sun she didn’t know her friend was missing until last month. “People told me that she was last seen at the pub with some guy. I know the guy because he wanted to have a relationship with her. At one point, we fought him off because he wanted to take her to his house while she was drunk,” she said. Siphelele said she went to see Cleo’s mum and asked for permission to look for her. She then opened a missing persons case at the cop shop, and the search began. A week later, she and friends Asanda Reletyana (41) and Bonga Poopedi (27) went to the suspect’s house. He wasn’t there. They asked cops to search the place.

A man (38) has since been arrested and detained”. The suspect appeared in the Mitchells Plain Magistrates Court on 30 January, facing a charge of murder, and the case was postponed to 23 March.
