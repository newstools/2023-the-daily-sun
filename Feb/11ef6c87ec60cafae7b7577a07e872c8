A resident told the SunTeam that the owner of the shack told them that at about midnight, a man knocked on his shack. He apparently said when he opened the door, three other men - one of whom was armed - forced their way in. The neighbour said the owner said he then jumped and grabbed his knobkerrie and allegedly hit the one with a gun on his hand. It's alleged he then proceeded to moer the three other intruders with the help of his nephew.
