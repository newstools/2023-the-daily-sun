THE first Cabinet Lekgotla of the year started yesterday, 2 February, in the absence of deputy president David Mabuza. The lekgotla, which will end today, was held at the Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guest House in Tshwane. Ministers, deputy ministers, premiers, directors-general and the leadership of the South African Local Government Association attended. President Cyril Ramaphosa chaired the meeting alone due to Mabuza’s absence. Minister in the Presidency, Mondli Gungubele, said he did not know why Mabuza did not attend but said he did send his apologies to the president. He said among the topics of discussion were the energy crisis, crime, poverty and service delivery. He said there was a strong desire to end load shedding as quickly as possible. Gungubele said calls for a national state of disaster would be discussed.

Gungubele said a possible cabinet reshuffle would not be discussed. The lekgotla will give the national executive a chance to review the performance of the government against targets and objectives set in 2022. President spokesman Vincent Magwenya said the government would also use the platform to come to an agreement on key action needed to advance the economy’s recovery with the electricity crisis being a top priority. “The lekgotla resolutions will form the basis of the State of the Nation Address, which President Ramaphosa will deliver to a joint sitting of the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces at Cape Town City Hall on Thursday, 9 February,” he said. The office of the deputy president said Mabuza could not attend as he has lost his brother and he is busy with funeral preparations.
