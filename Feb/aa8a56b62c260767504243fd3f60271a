AS heavy rains continue to wreak havoc in most areas of Mpumalanga, motorists and pedestrians have been urged to avoid overflowing low-lying bridges and river banks as they might be easily swept away. The warning comes after five workers, contracted to Transnet, escaped death when their truck was swept away while trying to cross the bridge at Schuilspruit dam in Amersfoort on Thursday, 16 February. According to Brigadier Selvy Mohlala, the workers, one woman and four men, were rescued while two were inside the truck and three on its rooftop. They were rescued by Emergency Medical Services, the fire department and other community structures. REGISTER TO COMMENT! “After the five were rescued, police and other stakeholders rendered assistance to a motorist from Rustenburg who also got stuck with his bakkie. Residents are reminded that flowing water applies pressure on contact points – the higher the speed, the more the pressure.” Mohlala further urged motorists and pedestrians to stay away when there was water pressure in flooded routes. Provincial police commissioner Lieutenant-General Semakaleng Manamela has expressed her disappointment after numerous warnings about people who were still gambling with their lives. “Important appointments can always be rescheduled rather than honouring them at the expense of your precious life,” she said.
