The Tshwane Magistrates’ Court has sentenced Modesty Rakamone Chauke (39),
to seven years direct imprisonment, Thalitha Ngwenya (38), and Nicholas Daniel
Mthimunye (41), to eight years direct imprisonment for housebreaking with intent
to steal and theft of valuables worth over R30 000. According to National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokeswoman Lumka
Mahanjana on 30 September 2020, Chauke and others broke into the complainants’
residence in Pierre Van Rynere, Centurion, and stole two laptops, two
televisions, a tablet, jewellery, and a make-up powder holder. ALSO READ: DEAD husband stopped my tlof tlof for 8 years She said when the complainant was driving into the complex, he noticed
Chauke and others exiting the complex, and when he arrived at his house, he
then realised that a break-in had occurred. “As he was viewing the CCTV footage, he then identified Chauke and others in
the footage. After alerting the security guards, they were all caught on the
run and handed over to the police by the security guards.” “They have been in custody since their arrest after the NPA successfully
opposed bail,” she said. Mahanjana said during the judgement, it was put on record that Mthimunye,
was still on probation on a case of possession of presumably stolen goods and
that all three men have previous convictions of housebreaking and robbery. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments In aggravation of sentence Public Prosecutor, Dru Ramsamy, told the court
that statistics show that home invasions are prevalent in the country. She said such crimes as the one committed by the accused violate the
constitutional right to dignity and security of the victims. “Had owners been home when the incident occurred, with these accused
backgrounds, it’s unlikely that they would have steered away from violence,”
said Ramsamy. She therefore, asked the court to
send a message that a career in crime does not get rewarded by the justice
system.
