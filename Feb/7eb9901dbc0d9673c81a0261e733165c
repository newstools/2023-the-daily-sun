PARENTS from Duma Primary School in Pienaar, Mpumalanga, want the Department of Education to fulfil its promises. On Monday, 27 February, a group of concerned parents shut down the school, claiming the department is neglecting them. They claim several meetings were held where they were promised infrastructure renovations three years ago, but nothing has been done. The school, which accommodates more than 300 pupils, has only one working pit toilet. The ceiling has collapsed in some classrooms and the fence has been damaged. The chairman of the school governing body, Steven Mashaba, told Daily Sun their children were no longer safe as the ceilings continued to collapse. He said last week pupils had to be released early from school after some were bitten by ticks from the ceiling. "The situation here is not conducive for teaching and learning. Teachers and our children are not safe," he said. He said tsotsis are now taking advantage and vandalising the school. Mashaba said there's no security guarding the school and it becomes difficult to monitor movements. ALSO READ:Â Crash claims 7 lives!
