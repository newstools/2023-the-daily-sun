FAMILIES and residents of Diepkloof, Soweto, picketed outside the Orlando Magistrates Court on Tuesday, 28 February. They were demanding justice for their loved ones who were brutally murdered, allegedly by a teacher on 21 January. Daily Sun previously published the story, headlined: 3 Killed for Polo Lights, about the three young men who were accused of stealing headlights from a VW Polo before they were killed and had their eyes removed. This incident took place on 21 January 2023. The 30-year-old teacher was arrested on Thursday, 2 February, after four people were allegedly assaulted by about seven suspects.   He's charged with murder and attempted murder and is out on a R20 000 bail.  The matter was postponed to the 23 May pending investigations. The mother of one of the young men who were killed, Pertunia Letsheli, said she wanted justice. "It is sad that it's dragging so much and consuming our emotions," she said.

"I don't care if the law says he's innocent until proven guilty. What about our loved ones who died in their hands? We need action," she said. The mum of another victim said she hasn't been okay since her son died. She said she needed sleeping tablets to sleep. "I think I'm also afraid of them and questioning if these men would come for me as well. I'm questioning this because of how they brutally murdered my son," she said. Families and residents told Daily Sun the suspect was allegedly seen around the school teaching as if nothing had happened. Gauteng education spokesman Steve Mabona confirmed the department was concerned about the allegations of murder levelled against their teacher. He said the department had launched an internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding this matter for necessary action to be taken.
