SHE was injured after she was allegedly assaulted with a brick by her neighbour on 5 December. So Sylvia Kunene, who has a laceration behind her ear and a bruise on the chest, opened a case at KwaThema Police Station. But the 59-year-old now suspects that a cop in charge of her case wants to sweep it under the carpet. She claimed the cop told her and her husband, Johnny (56), that her case is weak and boring, and allegedly threw out the J88 form, which records medical evidence. Sylvia from KwaThema, Ekurhuleni, said the case never made it to court as the senior prosecutor doesn’t know about it.  “We suspect something fishy here. The neighbour is going around boasting that we are wasting our time because she’s connected to the police in KwaThema,” said Johnny. She said: “I just want to expose the policewoman for denying me justice and for being biased. She’s apparently friends with the neighbour who assaulted me.” You must be SIGNED IN to read comments  The fight started when Sylvia’s son borrowed a needle from the neighbour. She said her son then lent it to another neighbour. When the owner of the needle found out, she became furious, claiming the other neighbour was going to bewitch her. Sylvia said she was trying to calm her down when she was assaulted. Sylvia said she went to the cop shop bleeding and cops told her to go to the doctor. “The doctor treated me but told me to go back to the police station to ask for a J88 for him to fill it.” Lieutenant-Colonel Mavela Masondo said an assault case was opened and they are investigating the claims about the cop who allegedly threw away the J88 document.
