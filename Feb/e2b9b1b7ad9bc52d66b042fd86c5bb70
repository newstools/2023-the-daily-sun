COPS have arrested a gang targeting the LGBTQI community. According to the police, the gang has been using a dating app designed for the LGBTQI community to lure victims to secluded places, kidnap and then rob them. Their latest victim was a 26-year-old man who had been chatting to one of the suspects online. The victim was allegedly robbed of his personal belongings including bank cards and his Mercedes Benz C180 was hijacked. However, the four suspects aged between 25 and 33 were cornered at a restaurant in Parktown, north of Joburg by the Anti-Kidnapping Task Team earlier this week. They made their first court appearance on Wednesday, 14 February, and the matter has been postponed to 21 February. Police spokeswoman Brigadier Athlenda Mathe said: “A group of four men who target members of the public based on their sexual orientation were arrested. A 26-year-old man who had been chatting to one of the suspects was lured to an area where he was hijacked, kidnapped and robbed off his personal belongings including bank cards.
