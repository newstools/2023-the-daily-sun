CITY Power has condemned landlords whose actions have left paying tenants around Midrand in darkness. This comes after City Power continued with its electrical bill blitz operation in Midrand on Monday, 13 February. Its spokesman Isaac Mangena said several businesses – mainly residential complexes around Midrand, who have failed to settle a combined electricity bill of R37 million, were disconnected. He said this is part of City Power’s rigorous revenue collection drive implemented across the city. “Over R340 million is owed by businesses and individuals in Midrand. The operation today paid a visit to the following defaulting and non-paying customers: Silver Stream residential complex in Halfway Gardens was the first to get cut-off for owing over R9 million. Car dealership in Randjespark has a bill of R4,9 million, which it had failed to pay, Thirty First Investment in Allendale owes R4,2 million, Telkom Site in Halfway House owes R2,4 million, Ille de Capri residential complex in Vorna Valley owes R2,4 million, Cedar Roc residential complex in Vorna Valley owes R2,1 million, Halfway Gardens Res Trust Palisades owes R1,8 million and Kyalami business park owes R1,5 million,” he said.
