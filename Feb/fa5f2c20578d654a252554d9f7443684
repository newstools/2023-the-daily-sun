THERE was no school on Thursday, 9 February, at Tumahole in Parys, Free State, as angry residents took to the streets over water. Schools issued letters on Wednesday, informing parents that they shouldn’t bring their kids to school due to the protest. Last month, residents barricaded roads with burning tyres and rocks, and allegedly torched the house belonging to the relative of Mayor Victoria de Beer. They were protesting for having no water for almost two years as taps had such dirty water that many people had allegedly been hospitalised after drinking it. Ntswaki Motloung told Daily Sun that in the past two years, she has been getting water from a pipe on the street. And at times, the water came out dirty or salty with a bad odour. She said that they had been complaining to the municipality about the problem for years, yet the issue was still not resolved. Motloung said that people who could afford to were buying water while others were forced to drink the dirty and smelly water from pipes.

Police spokeswoman Constable Maselela Langa said the unrest started on Wednesday as residents were still unsettled regarding the service delivery rendered by the municipality. Then in the early hours of Thursday, 9 February, they started burning tyres, barricading the main roads and allegedly looting tuck shops. “Police were called to monitor the township, and 12 suspects were arrested for looting. They are expected to appear in court soon,” she said.
