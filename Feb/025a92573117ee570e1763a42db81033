THE BEACH is a place for colourful swimwear and happy laughter as people enjoy the sun and waves. But strange objects, and even dead chickens, are found near the water. AND WHAT IS A MYSTERIOUS MAN IN WHITE ROBES DOING BETWEEN THE ROCKS? The objects that have been making beachgoers uncomfortable include sliced red and white candles, dolls wrapped with red ropes as well as dead chickens. People on Monwabisi Beach in Cape Town on Saturday, 4 February, told the SunTeam that they had been seeing strange things at the beach. “I saw a doll with a red rope in between the rocks at the beach, and some candles close by,” said Noluthando Mdlelenin (28) from Khayelitsha.  “I don’t know what that means, but I suspect these things are for muthi. My fear is that this muthi may affect us.” ALSO READ: TREE MUTHI RITUAL: A TRAP FOR CHEATING PARTNER! Beachgoer Tendai Chirenga (34) from Mandalay, said he saw a dead black chicken at Strandfontein Beach last week. “I decided to go to Monwabisi Beach, hoping to not come across more mysterious things,” he said. “But I see candles cut into pieces. I don’t know what that means, but I think there should be a designated area for rituals,” said Chirenga.  Sangoma Phindile “Gilindoda” Mtonga from Khayelitsha said dolls and chickens could be used to hurt people. He said that candles were used to get rid of evil spirits. “In most cases, these dolls have people’s names. People whose names are given to these dolls thrown on the beach could experience a series of bad luck, and you will find that their lives are not going forward,” he said.

He said that the candles were mostly used by apostolic churches to help them with their rituals. “In most cases, they are just used to wash away bad luck and evil spirits.”
