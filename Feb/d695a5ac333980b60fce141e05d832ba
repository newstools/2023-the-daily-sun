LIKE any other woman, she expected to be showered with gifts on Valentine’s Day. But instead, she got acid thrown into her face! After her boyfriend threw acid on her face, he tried to flee but residents of Maryvale in Duduza, Ekurhuleni, caught him. Both the victim and her boyfriend are in hospital as he drank the acid in an attempt to kill himself after the attack. The incident happened on Tuesday, 14 February, as the woman was preparing to leave for work in the morning. Residents said they heard her screaming for help and rushed to the scene. They chased her boyfriend, believed to be in his late 50s, when he tried to flee. Resident Paul Makobetsi (40) said he was in his shack when he heard residents shout “vimba” and came out to help. The boyfriend was running thorough his yard with a mob chasing. “I was shocked to discover the suspect was someone I knew. “He had a container of acid in his hand and his girlfriend’s handbag,” he said. Paul said the man dropped the bag and opened the bottle. He said he grabbed the bottle so the man could not drink from it. “I was not going to allow someone to die in front of me,” he said. But the man had already had a few sips. Paul’s hands and face were burnt by the acid as he wrestled it out of the man’s hands. Paul said the suspect was groaning in pain as they waited for an ambulance. The victim’s son told Daily Sun the acid luckily did not reach her eyes.
