GAUTENG Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, e-Government, Research and Development MEC, Mzikayifani Khumalo, has established a 100-day youth empowerment programme around Gauteng kasis. Khumalo said the purpose of the programme is to provide information and communications technology (ICT) opportunities to about 350 youth from previously disadvantaged areas such as Sebokeng. He was speaking at the Sedibeng Youth Tech Expo held at the Saul Tsotetsi Sports Centre at Sebokeng zone 14 in the Vaal on Tuesday, 24 January. The MEC was accompanied by Sedibeng Mayor Lerato Maloka. Khumalo said that technology presents an opportunity for growth and development, and the provincial government is at the forefront of the information technology revolution. REGISTER TO COMMENT “We believe that technological development is a vital construct for the political and economic sectors,” he said. He said the e-Government Department wanted to raise awareness on the great power that ICT possesses. “The department will give bursaries to students who passed matric not because their marks are good, but because they passed grade 12. “The discrimination of marks must come to an end. A pass is a pass,” he said. Khumalo encouraged young people to stay away from drugs. Mayor Maloka said the municipality’s aim is to help the youth develop their careers. “We want to help the youth by opening up opportunities essential for their growth, whether in employment or entrepreneurship, as the region has a high unemployment rate. “The municipality invited several stakeholders, especially in ICT sector, to empower unemployed youth and those who want to study ICT to have knowledge of opportunities available to them,” said Maloka.
