POLICE Minister Bheki Cele has commanded all law enforcement agencies to do their job without fear or favour. Cele was addressing members of the South African Police Service, Cape Town Metro police, South African National Defence Force, National Traffic Police and Western Cape Provincial Traffic Police who were deployed to keep order ahead of the 2023 State of the Nation Address (Sona). “We must make sure that today, anyone who chooses to break the law has chosen the wrong day,” said Cele, adding that their duty was to enforce the law. President Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver his address at 7pm this evening at the Cape Town City Hall.

Currin said the outreach was to encourage the public to tune in to the address. He said the Sona is a key national event where the president of South Africa advises the nation on the government programme for the year and reflects on the progress made with regards to the commitments of the previous year’s address. “The head of the state will give us the State of the Nation Address. We all know that this gives us a sense of what’s going on in our country and what the challenges are.” He said he was happy with the reception he got from the public who showed an interest to tune in to the address. “Last year, we were almost beaten up when we were giving out flyers but today, I’m very much happy to see a very significant change,” he said.        Andiswa Ndlela said she will be tuning in and hopes that the president will address issues of unemployment and the age cut-off in employment programmes for the government. “This issue that people who are over 35 cannot get jobs in the government needs to be cancelled because we are suffering. We cannot be excluded from getting jobs but be wanted when it’s time to vote,” she said. She said: “I also want the president to stop load shedding. We are tired of it,” she said.    Unlike the previous years, the 2023 State of the Nation Address (SONA) finds the country sharing the same sentiments of frustration and lack of trust when it comes to the government. Several households are bound not to be able to watch the SONA due to the continuous power outages. South Africa is currently experiencing up to six hours of load shedding per day since October and this has cost the country billions of rands, with business having to close shop and people losing their jobs.
