IT was supposed to be a good day of learning and teaching. But things quickly changed during a prayer session on Friday, 17 February, at Mameriri High School in Ga-Sekgopo Village, outside Modjadjiskloof, Limpopo. Learning and teaching were disrupted after half of the school’s pupils started collapsing and hallucinating shortly after the prayer session. Some pupils fell down, rolled on the ground, cried and took their clothes off as if they were possessed by demons while others were just standing like statues. This left teachers and parents scared as they did not know what was happening to the children. This is because the same thing has been happening at various schools in the Rakwadu 2 Circuit since September last year. “We were happy and singing, but chaos erupted immediately after a prayer. We don’t know what was happening. It was the first time witnessing something like this,” said a 15-year-old pupil. Parents were called to fetch their children as some of them were getting worse. The parents and teachers are calling for some form of intervention because they feel that their children might end up failing because of this. Parent Phineus Ngobeni (44) said a mass prayer must be held for the pupils. You must be SIGNED IN to read comments  “We need a mass prayer for all high schools under this circuit. We feel that a demon has come to attack our children so that they don’t perform well. This demon must be taken out as soon as possible,” he said. Parents said they will ask the school management and the Department of Education to arrange the mass prayer. Education spokesman Mike Maringa said they were aware of the challenges reported by the schools under this circuit. “The schools have identified the affected pupils and we are engaging their parents to seek help and ensure that the matter is attended to. We have also asked for this not to disturb learning and teaching,” he said.
