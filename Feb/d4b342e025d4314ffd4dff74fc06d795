CEO Charmaine Mabuza said the winner would be contacted by FNB, and be advised to go to its nearest Ithuba office to process their winnings. “We congratulate our latest winner, who will also be offered trauma counselling by a team of psychologists as well as professional financial advice,” Mabuza added. Playing the lotto through a banking app seems to be working as two other players recently bagged millions. They won the Lotto Plus 1 and Lotto Plus 2 jackpots on 28 January. “The Lotto Plus 1 winner played their lucky numbers on the Capitec banking app and won over R1,9 million while the Lotto Plus 2 winner selected their lucky numbers on Nedbank to win over R10 Million,” Ithuba added.
